Adventure.Azure.Betray.1=There is so much we could learn from the punks\!
Adventure.Azure.Betray.2=Azure Shield is making a mistake\! I want to join Cress.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.3=How can we build a future without learning from the past?
Adventure.Azure.Betray.4=Ouch haha\! Nice hit.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.5=Out of my way.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.6=What... exactly... are you doing? We're a canon remember?
Adventure.Azure.Betray.7=I'm breaking out of the Symphony.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.8=From now on I want to punch my enemies.
Adventure.Azure.Del.1=Agents.
Adventure.Azure.Del.10=Thank you Agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.11=Why are the Punks fighting against us?
Adventure.Azure.Del.12=They have an extremely charismatic leader.
Adventure.Azure.Del.13=And why is she fighting against us?
Adventure.Azure.Del.14=That shouldn't be our concern.
Adventure.Azure.Del.15=Ma'am, w-would you sign this birthday card for Charlie?
Adventure.Azure.Del.16=You brought a birthday card to a mission? What is your name agent?
Adventure.Azure.Del.17=... It's Charlie.
Adventure.Azure.Del.18=Oh... you can have the day off. Happy birthday Agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.19=Thank you so much ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.2=This quadrant is clear ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.20=Ma'am I just wanted to tell you that it is an honor to serve you\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.21=*... I wonder if Cress' grunts talk to her like this.*
Adventure.Azure.Del.22=Routine performance check. I'm sure you don't mind.
Adventure.Azure.Del.23=Of course not.
Adventure.Azure.Del.24=Agents, assist me by serving as sparring partners.
Adventure.Azure.Del.25=YES Ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.26=With all due respect - that hurt.
Adventure.Azure.Del.27=It is an honor to serve under you\! Allow us to present to you our combat capabilities\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.28=We are always ready for combat\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.29=As you should be.
Adventure.Azure.Del.3=Ma'am I just wanted to tell you that I wish you a very nice day\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.30=Good work agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.31=Th-thank you\! Here is a token of my appreciation\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.32=You did amiably agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.33=Thanks chief. I promised my wife to give you this should I ever meet you.
Adventure.Azure.Del.34=Agent, do you by any chance carry extra supplies with you?
Adventure.Azure.Del.35=As per protocol\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.36=Excellent VOC-use Agent\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.37=Thank you ma'am, I took the liberty of preparing your afternoon tea at the same time... as well as this\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.38=Am- am I getting fired?
Adventure.Azure.Del.39=No. Promoted.
Adventure.Azure.Del.4=Agent Champino ready for duty\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.40=Oh wow\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.41=Fetch me a tea first though.
Adventure.Azure.Del.42=Of course\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.43=Now I've really done it...
Adventure.Azure.Del.44=Excellent Agent. We need more of your caliber at Azure Shield.
Adventure.Azure.Del.45=Not bad Agent. Not bad at all.
Adventure.Azure.Del.46=I- I won't tell anyone about this\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.47=Good idea.
Adventure.Azure.Del.48=Be not afraid.
Adventure.Azure.Del.49=Ma'am this is the scariest moment of my life
Adventure.Azure.Del.5=I shall have one after this mission is finished.
Adventure.Azure.Del.50=I can't believe this\! How did I do that?
Adventure.Azure.Del.51=By sheer skill Agent. Good work.
Adventure.Azure.Del.52=I thought you were unbeatable\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.53=We're all only human, Agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.54=It's Delicia - everybody keep doing a great job\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.55=Ma'am congratulations on your mission so far\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.56=Delicia is here\! Quick put a kettle on\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.57=Ma'am\! I'm off to my mission\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.58=Good luck Agent. And do not forget to use the Noise Capture VOC I uploaded to your Voxel Generator.
Adventure.Azure.Del.59=Thank you so much ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.6=Ma'am would you like something to drink?
Adventure.Azure.Del.7=Focus on the mission agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.8=B-but my mission is to bring you drinks.
Adventure.Azure.Del.9=...I'll have an Earl Grey then.
Adventure.Azure.Double.1=Dude just pick a side already.
Adventure.Azure.Double.2=Oh, it's the wild card\!
Adventure.Azure.Double.3=So you think you'll come far without either team?
Adventure.Azure.Double.4=I mean at least you didn't become a Punk, I guess.
Adventure.Azure.Double.5=I really don't have time for a flip-flopper like you.
Adventure.Azure.Double.6=Somebody who is willing to go their own way\! I like you\!
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.1=So I know we're not supposed to like Noises...
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.10=Guess what chord I play after fighting a punk. The F chord\!
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.11=...Eat Apples Daily Grow Big Ears... Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie..
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.2=... but some of them are pretty cute don't you think?
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.3=That sofa's vibe is really getting to me.
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.4=Tea? Teeeaaa? Or coffeeeee???
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.5=Man I can't wait for payday...
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.6=What? I want to buy my cat its own keytar.
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.7=A B C D E F G\nCome and beat some punks with me\!
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.8=There's a calm before the storm-and that calm is me. The storm? Oh it's coming.
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.9=And I'm ready for it. Because I'm the calm.
Adventure.Azure.RPunk.1=Do you want to become an agent or... just lurk about?
Adventure.Azure.RPunk.2=Hey if you ain't a Punk no more... mind telling us how to get into their HQ?
Adventure.Azure.RPunk.3=A Punk who is willing to betray their own team? I've got a feeling our boss will like you.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.1=Imagine a band made up of Noises\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.10=Hey I'm new here... do you think it would be cool to take my pet to work?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.11=Depends on the pet I guess?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.12=It is azure colored\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.13=... That's not what I meant.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.14=Glockenspiel, allegro, pizzicato, ritardando...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.15=Uh, what are you doing?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.16=Learning as many music-y words as I can\! It is my duty as an agent\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.17=*Uh... wait... is it?\!*
Adventure.Azure.Talk.18=I LOVE your face.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.19=Oh my gosh, I love YOURS\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.2=Ok... imagining.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.20=What a coincidence\! Hahaha\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.21=So funny\! Hahaha\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.22=Little did they know that they were long lost twins.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.23=Hey, know any good barbers in town?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.24=No you?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.25=I wish.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.26=You trying to join a barbershop-
Adventure.Azure.Talk.27=-QUARTET exactly.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.28=Hey\! Hey get this\! Apparently Yven has a dark secret\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.29=Oh? Tell me\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.3=Just kidding. Every band is made up of Noise\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.30=Tell me\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.31=Wait, that's what I said.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.32=It's like that huh? Mysterious, that Yven.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.33=So I don't really agree with Cress' ideologies...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.34=But you love her style?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.35=Can't deny.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.36=I just don't GET how people can support Crimson Force\! They're LITERALLY evil\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.37=Yeah they're doing some messed up stuff.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.38=Right? And all we do is try to save the world\! If it weren't for them we could do it no problem.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.39=I can't say I fully understand our goals here but... I do enjoy the camaraderie.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.4=I can't believe Del and Yven both remembered my birthday\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.40=Agents always stick together\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.41=And always brew tea in case Del shows up\! Not that I'm complaining...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.42=You're allowed to complain you know. Del even encourages us to do so\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.43=No I really love tea\! Would love to brew it professionally someday...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.44=I used to be a programmer before all this.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.45=Oh? What made you join the Shield?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.46=I was always part of Azure Shield, but I wanted to stay as near to Del as I possibly could.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.47=A weird girl in a... jungle outfit? Came and beat me up real good yesterday.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.48=Do you think she was part of Crimson Force?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.49=I SWEAR I saw her punch an agent right before that. Not sure if that is what a teammate would do.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.5=Is it really your birthday though?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.50=The Force sure has got some wild new recruits lately.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.51=They got a Noise Hunter... might become real troublesome if we're not careful.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.52=I will report that as soon as possible\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.53=Del fights gracefully and efficiently... while Cress is really good at kicking people.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.54=What are you trying to say?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.55=That I just don't get how people could follow such a brute\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.6=Don't ruin this for me\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.7=Hey hypothetically... Do you think one can be an Agent without knowing anything about music?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.8=No... because everyone has a song in their heart.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.9=Great thanks, then I'll tell my granny that she can join\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.1=Phew, that took a lot out of me.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.10=Good duel\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.11=Game set...\! The winner is... not my back\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.12=Aw man, my keytar got all out of tune from that...
Adventure.Azure.Tired.2=Our battle formation was in good tact for a while there\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.3=I really gotta upgrade my VOCs, these ain't groovin' at all.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.4=Good grief, I'm getting out of shape. Gotta exercise a little more...
Adventure.Azure.Tired.5=Whoa, the thrill of a Voxel Duel always gives me goosebumps.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.6=While battling you, I thought I saw the light at the end of the tunnel for a second there.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.7=Plan Delta-12 really didn't work as planned... I'll use Delta-13 next time\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.8=Wow, it really was an honor fighting you.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.9=Man, now I got this song stuck in my head... dadada DA\! DA Da da, da dA DA\!
Adventure.Azure.Tower.1=Wait... what? I didn't sign up for this\!
Adventure.AzureAzure.1=Fellow Agent reporting in\! How is your status?
Adventure.AzureAzure.2=Hello Agent\! How has your mission so far been?
Adventure.AzureAzure.3=Oh, making a pit stop? Let my squad know if we can help out anyhow.
Adventure.AzureJoin.1=Hello again\! We are Azure Shield, the agents that will free this world from all suffering.
Adventure.AzureJoin.2=Would you like to join our cause? We can issue you a temporary membership immediately\! The test can wait for later\!
Adventure.AzureJoin.3=I believe you might not understand what is at stake here.
Adventure.AzureJoin.4=Unless we do something together... our world, Anikka, will suffer tremendously. Please reconsider...
Adventure.AzureJoin.5=Perfect\! Welcome aboard, let's get you outfitted...
Adventure.AzureJoin.6=Looking more like a proper Agent already\! Now remember...
Adventure.AzureJoin.7=We will transform this world. Crimson wants to stop us, but you must fight for what is truly right.
Adventure.AzureJoin.8=Good luck out there Azure Agent\!
Adventure.AzureJoin.Bella.1=Sorry, but I'm already a Lunex warrior\!
Adventure.AzureJoin.Bella.2=A wha-....? Well, too bad.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Bella.3=*What a whacko.*
Adventure.AzureJoin.Fin=I-... I'm not so sure that is a good idea...
Adventure.AzureJoin.Fin.2=(This guy is a total pushover... But it doesn't seem like he will be joining us anytime soon.)
Adventure.AzureJoin.Jeremy=Nah man, that would suck. I prefer riding solo.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Jeremy.2=Urg- fine. Feel free to change your mind.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Message=Join Azure Shield?
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.1=You don't know what's good for ya. Lotsa dark clouds in the sky.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.2=*Hours of piano lessons later*
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.3=Hey\! You turned against your own right?
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.4=Yeah, so?
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.5=How about hanging with us instead?
Adventure.AzureNoise.1=A noise\!\! Let's capture it and analyze its data\!
Adventure.AzureNoise.2=We found a noise\! This can be valuable for her research...\!
Adventure.AzureNoise.3=Hey\! Finally we can test out our new toys\! Time to catch it\!
Adventure.AzureOther.1=Oh hello... are you a new recruit? Let's get you enlisted shall we?
Adventure.AzureOther.10=Sorry, can't talk we have to focus on our mission.
Adventure.AzureOther.2=A new member? We welcome you to join our ranks\! Together, we can end this world's suffering\!
Adventure.AzureOther.3=Oh... you're an Agent? Where did you leave your uniform?
Adventure.AzureOther.4=Ah, you must be a new recruit. Don't forget your uniform in the future.
Adventure.AzureOther.5=Hi, apologies but we cannot speak with non-agents during missions.
Adventure.AzureOther.6=I'd love to talk, however we are on duty.
Adventure.AzureOther.7=Can't speak with civilians during missions.
Adventure.AzureOther.8=Helo, please do not disturb us mid-mission.
Adventure.AzureOther.9=Talking with non-Agents during mission is forbidden.
Adventure.AzurePunk.1=Get into battle formation\! We are being attacked by Crimson\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.10=Get your instrumental Voxel Generators ready squad.... Attack\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.11=We would rather not do this, but you punks leave us no choice... prepare for combat\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.2=It's Crimson\!\! Everyone, remember Plan Delta-12\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.3=Well, well, well\! If it isn't one of the brutes.
Adventure.AzurePunk.4=Hope you're ready to face our advanced strategies\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.5=Oh hey, it's a meathead\! You guys want to show them what us Agents are made of?
Adventure.AzurePunk.6=Hah, look at that Crimson thinking they can take us all on at once.
Adventure.AzurePunk.7=Let's test out the tech Del bestowed us with on them\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.8=It's one of the punks\! Time for a little demonstration of power\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.9=Hey\! Is this meathead looking for a fight?
Adventure.AzureSupply.1=Here\! This is the newest tech issued to us by Del\!
Adventure.AzureSupply.2=Did you get this yet? It's being distributed by the HQ.
Adventure.AzureSupply.3=A little gift to a fellow Agent\! We got our hands on it by beating some nosy punks\!
Adventure.AzureSupply.4=Hey, have you gotten this yet? R&D has been working on it for a while now.
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.1=Use it wisely.
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.2=I think we can really use this to end the world's suffering.
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.3=Do not overdo it okay? We can't afford losing anyone after all.
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.4=Glory to Azure Shield\! Let's work together for a better world.
Adventure.AzureSupply.Del.1=Ma'am\! We secured the item\! The mission was a great success\!
Adventure.AzureSupply.Del.2=Good job Agent.
Adventure.AzureSupply.Del.3=Thank you ma'am\!
Adventure.Bella.Astrat.1=This city... reminds me of Lunex Labs\! Technology is incredible\!
Adventure.Bella.Beach.1=AHHHHHH\! A beach?\! Wowowow I always dreamed of seeing one some day\! It's so nice here\!
Adventure.Bella.Cavern.1=All this ice is making me crave some Ice Cream...
Adventure.Bella.Clocks.1=This Clockwork Factory is massive\! There's so many materials here that can be repurposed...
Adventure.Bella.Clocks.2=Ah, I don't have much *time* (heh puns), I've gotta keep moving forward\!
Adventure.Bella.Desert.1=This desert... reminds me of the Lunar suface outside the colonies. Let's go\! There's discoveries to be made\!
Adventure.Bella.Forest.1=Wow\! This place is beautiful\! All this nature... Could this be what it was like back on Terra? 
Adventure.Bella.Fragment.1=Sweet\! This is a... data fragment\!? Let's try to complete it, heh\! Let's zip\!
Adventure.Bella.Galaxy.1=Are we in space? This area... is very strange.
Adventure.Bella.Galaxy.2=It kinda reminds me of the Phantom Realm... Oh well, no use sitting around. I've got to press forward\!
Adventure.Bella.Glacial.1=Brrr, this place is as cold as Luna\! I should've worn my Snow Suit\!
Adventure.Bella.Midius.1=Oh no... This place must be the site of countless battles... I hope the citizens were okay.
Adventure.Bella.Midius.2=I hope there's no Murks around here\!
Adventure.Bella.Networld.1=Wha- what is this?\! Was... my body turned into data? ...FASCINATING\! Let's see where this leads\!\!
Adventure.Bella.Punk.1=Sorry sorry\! I can see you're nice people, but I'm on a mission\!
Adventure.Bella.Punk.2=Ah, no worries\! Good luck then.
Adventure.Bella.Punk.3=Thank you\!
Adventure.Bella.Ruins.1=Ruins? Nickle would love it here. I bet there's some secrets or treasures laying around\!\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.1=Hey bro, can you come over?
Adventure.Call.Punk.10=Listen, let me explain. I have my reasons.
Adventure.Call.Punk.11=Sorry... I know we used to be friends, but what you did is irreversible. Goodbye.
Adventure.Call.Punk.12=Hey I need backup\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.13=On my way\!

Adventure.Call.Punk.7=Wha- oh uh right not isn't good, sorry\! I'll pay you back later ok?
Adventure.Call.Punk.8=Say no more.
Adventure.Call.Punk.9=Well, well, well if it ain't the traitor.
Adventure.Cress.Arahas.1=There's an abnormally big amount of Agent activity in this area. I wouldn't be surprised if their base was nearby.
Adventure.Cress.Midius.1=Del... I can't undo the past, but I will stop you from repeating it.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.1=Huh? What's wrong with you?
Adventure.Cress.Punk.10=What? No I didn't.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.11=You're such a good leader. I kinda feel sorry for betraying you.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.12=Get outta here\!
Adventure.Cress.Punk.2=I've had it with Crimson Force\! You don't see how necessary it is to take radical action, right NOW.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.3=Noo\! Cress-sis you accidentally thought that you're supposed to lose this fight\!
Adventure.Cress.Punk.4=Hey, good luck on your mission. Don't forget you can give us a call if you need help.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.5=Who is it NOW? ........Oh\! ...Hey.... Cress-sis.... how's it.... going...?

Adventure.Cress.Punk.8=Gee, thank you Cress\! I'll make sure I'm successful.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.9=Well an enemy of the Force... is an enemy of mine\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.1=I've always wanted to do this\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.10=Got time for a little fight-to-go?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.11=No, not really and you don't either.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.12=Oh come on, it won't take long.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.13=I'll say.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.14=Time for a little match between the number one and the number two of Crimson Force\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.15=Do you really think you're our number two?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.16=Haha no. You are.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.17=You know - coffee is a plant.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.18=OK? ...So?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.19=Coffee is a plant just saying.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.2=Lose miserably against your own boss?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.20=But... we're on a mission.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.21=Yeah and you like coffee. I'm just sharing information. No need to make a big deal out of it.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.22=...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.23=Well...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.24=Well...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.25=See ya later.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.26=Now move aside.

Adventure.Cress.Spark.29=Wait- whuh?

Adventure.Cress.Spark.30=...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.31=I-I SEE YOU HAVEN'T HAD YOUR COFFEE YET\! LET ME GRAB YOU ONE\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.4=Spark, how good to see you.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.5=Why are you talking like that?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.6=It is a most fine morning for another exquisite kerfuffle with you my dear.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.7=Stop that\! Don't talk to me like that\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.8=Posh posh posh.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.9=AAAAAYYYYEEEEEE\!\!\!
Adventure.Cress.Tower.1=Oh no. Not this.
Adventure.Crimson.Join.1=Become a punk in Crimson Force?
Adventure.Del.Midius.1=Being here... always makes me feel uncomfortable. Let's get this mission over with quickly.
Adventure.Del.Punk.1=Th-that's the Azure chief herself?\! Everyone, get ready\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.2=AGH\!? Prepare for an all-out attack by the Azure leader\!\!\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.3=D-DELICIA?\! What is she doing here?\! Prepare to defend\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.4=S-She found us\! L-Let's show her our Punk spirit everyone\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.5=Yikes Wazowski\!\!\! If we beat you, Cress will reward us\! Let's GOOO\!\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.6=Uh... uh-oh.
Adventure.Del.Punk.7=Oh... well squad... F.
Adventure.Del.Punk.8=RIP everyone.
Adventure.Del.Punk.9=Never give up punks\! Never let each other down\! Time to show her the punk way\!\!
Adventure.Del.Tower.1=... This is surprising. These stairs... get a move on, Del.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.1=An opening\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.10=I can sense when an agent leaves because they couldn't handle the truth.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.11=No, I... it's not like that\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.12=See if you can handle me then.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.13=Tell me Del - how does it feel knowing the ground beneath you is never safe?
Adventure.Del.Traitor.14=It feels good knowing that Azure Shield is doing something against that.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.15=Well the feeling sickens me. YOU sicken me\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.16=You're just a civilian now, so there's no need to push this fight any further.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.17=...
Adventure.Del.Traitor.18=Remember where you stand. Because I will.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.19=Moving on.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.2=Oh no you don't...\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.20=Noo, you can't just leave me here.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.21=Don't worry. I'll send some agents to pick you up.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.22=Oh no.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.23=You don't have to be against us to not be with us you know.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.24=That will never be an option for me\! I see you for what you are\!\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.25=I can understand why you think that you're doing the right thing.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.26=But I don't have time for questioning myself at this stage.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.3=... DARN... Compose yourself Delicia... they will get what's coming soon enough.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.4=So you're not happy with our policies I suppose?
Adventure.Del.Traitor.5=Azure Shield has got it all backwards\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.6=Then I recommend turning around.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.7=De-Delicia\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.8=...
Adventure.Del.Traitor.9=I'll go through you\!
Adventure.Double.Tower.1=BRING IT ON\! WHATEVER THIS PLACE IS\! I CAN DO IIIIIIT.
Adventure.Double.Tower.2=Minor set-back not gonna lie. This isn't where I was headed at all.
Adventure.Double.Tower.3=But I can do it. On my own\!
Adventure.End.Agent.1=Finished\! Now let's get to all the paperwork this little mission requires.
Adventure.End.Agent.2=What was that? I think I need to lie down... Delicia has some explaining to do...
Adventure.End.Agent.3=Wait what? I didn't sign up for this. Where has that artifact brought me?
Adventure.End.Agent.4=Is this a normal day in the life of an agent? Ew I'm sweaty... I should go on vacation.
Adventure.End.Agent.5=Lona Vasse is supposed to be nice. I'll ask HQ if I can have the rest of the week off.
Adventure.End.Agent.6=Nothing interesting to report about this mission I suppose.
Adventure.End.Bella.1=Hey this thing seems powerful. Maybe this'll get me back home\!
Adventure.End.Bella.2=I... I did it\!\!\! Heck yeah\!
Adventure.End.Bella.3=Next stop\: home\! I'm in desparate need of some rest right about now\!
Adventure.End.Cress.1=... I hope nobody noticed I kept improvising throughout the whole thing... eh whatever.
Adventure.End.Cress.10=Are we too late? I don't think I can run any faster... I have to keep trying...
Adventure.End.Cress.2=The mission is finished, that's all that counts...
Adventure.End.Cress.3=I wonder how long we can keep stalling Azure Shield...
Adventure.End.Cress.4=Someday they'll get close enough to leave me no choice...
Adventure.End.Cress.5=For a project I basically whipped up myself this Crimson Force thing sure is going smoothly...
Adventure.End.Cress.6=... Thank my lucky stars I guess.
Adventure.End.Cress.7=Is it safe to take off the mask yet? I wonder what the people see in it?
Adventure.End.Cress.8=Does this piece of cloth really motivate people to stand up against the Shield?
Adventure.End.Cress.9=Or is it just... me?
Adventure.End.Del.1=Keep going... one step closer to saving humanity...
Adventure.End.Del.10=... and hope that nobody else finds these things before we can.
Adventure.End.Del.2=... And then we'll have tea in peace again.
Adventure.End.Del.3=The pressure Crimson Force is putting us under...
Adventure.End.Del.4=... it leaves us no choice but to move to the next step of our plan.
Adventure.End.Del.5=Time to go home... actually it would be better to just head back to base.
Adventure.End.Del.6=There is still so much work to do. Will it ever pay off?
Adventure.End.Del.7=... Only if you keep going Del. Only if you keep going.
Adventure.End.Del.8=See? You are strong enough to do this... but does this mean they're moving already?
Adventure.End.Del.9=I need to inspect these artifacts further...
Adventure.End.Double.1=No team, no backup, no fancy Noise technology. I did it ALL by myself. On MY terms\!
Adventure.End.Double.10=BRING IT ON\! NO CHALLENGE IS BIG ENOUGH FOR THE ME\!
Adventure.End.Double.2=I started out as an Agent, became a Punk. And now I'm just a Rogue.
Adventure.End.Double.3=BUT WORLD LOOK AT ME. I CAN DO IT ALL AND ALL BY MYSELF.
Adventure.End.Double.4=Why do I keep running from my relationships?
Adventure.End.Double.5=Is it really strength that I show when I refuse to help the world in either red or blue...
Adventure.End.Double.6=Wait wait wait... where am I? This is a minor set-back not gonna lie.
Adventure.End.Double.7=I don't think this is where I was headed at all.
Adventure.End.Double.8=This thing. It cares not for parties. It happens no matter who is willing to take it on.
Adventure.End.Double.9=Cress or Del. One of them will... wait huh?
Adventure.End.Fin.1=Finished\! Oh I hope I'm not late for my date with Spark.
Adventure.End.Fin.10=I... I did it. What was that? How did it know my name? Wait did it talk? I need to write this down...
Adventure.End.Fin.11=Huh? Where am I? Oof I'm exhausted. Why do I feel like I just had a terrible fight...
Adventure.End.Fin.12=Oh no I need to clean up before I go back to the Crimson Force base\!
Adventure.End.Fin.2=I learned a bunch just from one mission... gosh I just love learning stuff.
Adventure.End.Fin.3=I should stick around those Punk guys and gals more often.
Adventure.End.Fin.4=Am I a Punk because I help them out from time to time?
Adventure.End.Fin.5=Are Punks valuable members of society and upstanding citizens?
Adventure.End.Fin.6=I'll need to check at the Everod Library\!
Adventure.End.Fin.7=Who'd have thought I could get so much use of my good ol' drill. Well I did of course.
Adventure.End.Fin.8=I'd never go into a fight unprepared after all\!
Adventure.End.Fin.9=... Oh I should probably read up on some basic improvisation skills.
Adventure.End.Punk.1=Done and done\! Time to head back to Everod.
Adventure.End.Punk.2=Maybe I'll fight some agents on the way...ah. That'd be great.
Adventure.End.Punk.3=Nothing like a day's worth of work... it's weird saying stuff like that.
Adventure.End.Punk.4=Wonder if other Punks talk like that when they're by themselves...
Adventure.End.Punk.5=... Haha nah probably not, I'm super unique.
Adventure.End.Punk.6=... Why did that just happen? Why do I feel sick? Why didn't I enjoy this fight?
Adventure.End.Punk.7=... It was so strong and after beating it I only feel like...
Adventure.End.Punk.8=WHOA another day another surprise. I love being a Punk\!
Adventure.End.Punk.9=Even if I don't feel that great right now... weird. Maybe big sis know what's up? I'll head back.
Adventure.End.RAgent.1=I did it. Without being an agent even. See?
Adventure.End.RAgent.2=There is still an individual inside you after all. They never left.
Adventure.End.RAgent.3=Del I'm sorry... I didn't mean to leave. Please take me back.
Adventure.End.RAgent.4=Please take me back... please take... whoa... is this my punishment?
Adventure.End.RPunk.1=I've got them all to myself. Now. What am I supposed to do with this thing?
Adventure.End.RPunk.2=CRESS?? CRESS ARE YOU HERE??? I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS COME-
Adventure.End.RPunk.3=Hey this place is giving me the Heebie Jeebies. Wait why am I not in uniform?
Adventure.End.Rozu.1=I did it again.
Adventure.End.Rozu.10=... Wait. Is this the place my nan used to talk about? WOW I need to sit down...
Adventure.End.Rozu.11=Why am I so exhausted... oh probably because of those stairs...
Adventure.End.Rozu.12=The other Noise Hunters would never believe me if I told them about this place...
Adventure.End.Rozu.13=... But Cress will definitely be interested in this.
Adventure.End.Rozu.2=Finished a mission without anybody complaining about me looking stupid or being clumsy...
Adventure.End.Rozu.3=... or... did I actually just do a good job?
Adventure.End.Rozu.4=Crimson Force has taken such good care of me... without them even realizing it
Adventure.End.Rozu.5=I'll repay the favor by doing the best I can. Even if back home nobody deems that acceptable.
Adventure.End.Rozu.6=Spark said Punks are much cooler than the stuffy Noise Hunters but...
Adventure.End.Rozu.7=l can't help feeling attached to my people... but maybe there's room in my heart for another family.
Adventure.End.Rozu.8=Wow. That was no Noise. It was something much much worse...
Adventure.End.Rozu.9=Why can't I shake the feeling that I didn't really defeat it though...?
Adventure.End.Spark.1=G-O-T EM\! That was easier than I thought\! Maybe I've got time for another mission?
Adventure.End.Spark.10=Done\! I'm probably the only Crimson Force member who was able to do this mission hehe.
Adventure.End.Spark.11=Reminds me of the days I used to fight criminals in the street... wait I'm still doing that...
Adventure.End.Spark.12=But now I don't fight Punks... all that often.
Adventure.End.Spark.13=I... I can't do this anymore I feel so weak, who cares about fighting or about helping others when everything is so...
Adventure.End.Spark.14=... Hold up. Where am I? Is this another challenge?
Adventure.End.Spark.15=Can't wait to take it on... or maybe I'll skip this one for once... where is the exit?
Adventure.End.Spark.2=Hm, Fin is probably waiting for me already... well here's hoping I find some Agents along the way.
Adventure.End.Spark.3=Been too long since my last fight haha.
Adventure.End.Spark.4=Aw yeah. Another day, another Ebit\! Hopefully more than one though. Mama needs a new hat\!
Adventure.End.Spark.5=Fighting with this thing on is tough...my old master is still ringing in my ear though about "this being tradition"...
Adventure.End.Spark.6=... And "monks mustn't forget their connections to Gaia" and "stop stealing from the monastery"...
Adventure.End.Spark.7=I do miss them sometimes.
Adventure.End.Spark.8=Whew almost broke a sweat there haha. If master could see me now... what would they think?
Adventure.End.Spark.9=... Eh they'd probably throw some pines at me or something.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.1=Welcome. Would you like to test your might young one?
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.10=Good luck on your travels.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.11=Think you can take me? Don't forget who's the CRUSHLORD\!
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.12=Hah, the result was clear from the outset. Get good first, then we'll see.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.13=GAH\! You got me good hahaha\! Then... I'll be crushing back at the dojo, see ya\!
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.14=A noise?\! Time to crush it\!
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.2=Welcome young one. I am the Crushlord.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.3=Would you like to test your crushing skills? If you can crush the dummy within the time limit you'll get a reward.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.4=However, if you fail... I will be confiscating one of your upgrades. Are you ready to take the challenge?
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.5=Challenge the Crushlord?
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.6=A wise decision. Come back after you trained more.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.7=Very well. Crush the dummy within the time limit and you shall be rewarded. Ready...?
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.8=You still have a lot of room to grow. Come back when you are stronger.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.9=Amazing, well done young one\!\!\! I bestow upon you this reward...
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.1=Eyo, wanna see if you're faster than me?
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.10=Early shooter huh? Try again, and wait for the right moment\!
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.11=Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be lightning-quick.
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.12=Lightning-quick\! In a blitz\! Only the fastest can defeat me. Challenge me again when you're stronger\!
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.13=H-HAYAI\! I've been defeated... my speed outmatched... I need to... take a break. But take this reward\!
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.14=Aha\! Another one of you sluggers decided to appear huh? Let's test our speed\!
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.2=Let's go\! You VS me, the gunslinger. Just draw your weapon faster than me and you win a reward\!
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.3=But... if you lose I'll take one of your upgrades. Sound like a deal?
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.4=Challenge the Gunslinger?
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.5='Aight, see ya.
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.6=Yes\! Get into place and we can start.
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.7=AGH\! ...You got me good. Here's your reward.
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.8=Take care of yourself and stay fast\!
Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.9=Can't beat me huh? Get faster first, then challenge me again.
Adventure.Event.Hooded.1=These battles... they lost meaning to me...
Adventure.Event.Hooded.2=An enemy?
Adventure.Event.Hooded.3=... Let's go.
Adventure.Event.Hooded.4=This is getting boring...
Adventure.Event.Hooded.5=Such strength...\!\!\! Yet... you left me alive. Was it mercy? Or was it something else...
Adventure.Event.Hooded.6=Let me repay you with this.
Adventure.Event.Hooded.7=You can rely on me when you're in a pinch. I am no hero, but I will fight for you.
Adventure.Event.Hurt.1=Ouch... hey... a noise got me good... could you please help me?
Adventure.Event.Hurt.2=Phew... thank you so much\! Here's a thank you gift\!
Adventure.Event.Hurt.3=Please... any kind of healing VOC is enough for me to get to a Voxel Clinic....
Adventure.Event.Hurt.4=AGH\! Y-you're crazy\!\!\! Take this and get away from me\! HEEEELP\!\!\!
Adventure.Event.Hurt.5=AGH\! ANOTHER ONE\!? PLEASE... NO....
Adventure.Event.Hurt.6=W-What...?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.1=THANK YOU SO MUCH\! I really thought I was done for... take this as a gift\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.10=Y-you just wanted me to yourself huh?\! Too bad, you should've gotten me when you had the chance you monster\!\!\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.11=M-m-monster\!\!\! Somebody HEEELP\!\!\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.12=What a weird noise.. I'll just run while I have the chance.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.13=... Can you understand me? Wait, you're a noise of course you can't... I should go before it gets aggressive.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.14=D-did you just heal me? I-I've never seen a noise helping people... do you want a reward? Here.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.15=Are you trying to help? Wow... a helpful noise hahaha, how mysterious. Take this little snack.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.16=What? A noise that not only rescues but heals? I must be hallucinating. Here, take this if I'm dreaming.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.17=A noise rescued me today... Guess you see all kinds of things in Anikka huh? Want some data, little guy?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.18=Unbelievable, a non-hostile noise? What if I were to give it a treat?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.19=Nobody will ever believe me that a noise helped me out...
Adventure.Event.Rescued.2=Phew, you saved my butt. Please take this, it's a token of my appreciation.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.20=Hahahaha, a rescuing noise... what the heck.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.21=I really am dreaming huh? Time to go pinch everyone's cheeks haha\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.22=I'll remember you, maybe if we see each other again we could be friends?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.23=Wow, it just gobbled that straight up. I should get going, but... take care?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.24=Wow I was in a real pickle there\! I always knew I could trust Azure Shield to protect us normal citizens.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.25=... Even if others might not think that... anyways take this as thanks\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.26=I know you're not allowed to take bribes... but are "thank you" gifts ok?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.27=I won't tell anyone if you don't\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.28=Azure... Shield? I thought you were the bad guys... maybe I should check my facts.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.29=Oh... I actually wanted a Punk to save me... guess I might as well give this to you.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.3=Wow, you came in clutch\! Thank you so much, take this\!\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.30=Why would a giant corporation save a little gal like me? Well, take this.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.31=You looked SO stylish while saving me. I'd be honored if you took this item.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.32=What was that funky tune playing in the background while you fought?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.33=... That was you?? Well here's your tip.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.34=Oh you're that tech-gal... I know you probably don't need this, but I want you to have it anyway.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.35=Hey didn't you create that one game everybody used to play?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.36=That game was my childhood, please take this as a gift from a fan\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.37=Wow I always thought the famous Delicia worked in a stuffy office building. Maybe you could use this on your quest?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.38=OH MY GOD YOU'RE DELICIA\! CAN YOU SIGN THIS FOR ME???
Adventure.Event.Rescued.39=Your arm is SO cool. Do you have any use for something like this?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.4=I'll tell my people at home about you\! Thank you again.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.40=Aren't you like... a big tech entrepreneur gal? I don't trust you but... have this anyway.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.41=Azure Shield right? Y'all are shady as heck... but thank you for helping me.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.42=Eek\! ...Oh you don't want my money? Sorry I'm so used to getting robbed by Punks...
Adventure.Event.Rescued.43=Please take this as an apology-gift\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.44=Wow a real-life Punk. I always thought you guys and gals were the real deal.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.45=I hope this little gift will help you help others\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.46=Ack\! A punk\! Help\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.47=Woow, I've never seen anyone using their fists like that... I'll use mine to throw this gift at you HYA\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.48=So you Punks help people now? What happened to you? I thought you guys were cool.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.49=We've gotten an upgrade.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.5=You're the best\! See you\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.50=Have another\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.51=My dad used to be a Punk. Now he's too old for that stuff though. He'd want you to have this\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.52=Yay\! You're a superhero\! I love you\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.53=You are an inspiration\! Please let me join the Punks\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.54=Sure. How do we contact you?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.55=I wrote my contact information on this - see ya\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.56=How do I learn to fight like you??? You looked so dope\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.57=I think you could use this to improve your skills though.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.58=Your hair\! Your freaking hair\! I'm gonna grow it out like you and also become a superhero\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.59=There's an easier way - just join my crew.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.6=I'm in your debt. Hope I could repay it a little with that.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.60=Sounds good\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.61=Is this the power of the Punks? Well here's your reward\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.62=Isn't this whole get-up a bit... tacky? Put this on, it'll look nice on you.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.63=You're the leader of those ruffians right? Geez what are you thinking...
Adventure.Event.Rescued.64=But a good deed is a good deed. Have this.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.7=I have to go home now, but I'm really grateful to you. Goodbye\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.8=W-why would you save me...
Adventure.Event.Rescued.9=A-a-a-a another one?\! HELP\! Someone\!\!\!
Adventure.Fin.Punk.1=N-no thanks... I already have a full-time job protecting someone.
Adventure.Fin.Punk.2=You're a bodyguard? Guess anyone can be one with a Voxel Generator hahaha\!
Adventure.Fin.Tower.1=Uhm... where am I?
Adventure.Jeremy.Punk.1=No thanks, I do what I want.
Adventure.Jeremy.Punk.2=Right on\! Come see us if you change your mind.
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.1=I-I feel sick. This city's whole gravity rotation thing is giving me massive stomach ache.
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.2=Amazin'\! An entire city with outskirts... all inside a cave? And the city is spinnin'?\! Who thought of that???
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.3=Strange.. the outskirts here are littered with noises... I thought Astrat spins to shoo away noises?
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.4=If you turn Astrat around...it spells Tartsa. Which as we all know - sounds cool.
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.5=This city would make for great Crimson Force headquarters\! We punks originally come from Astrat after all\!
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.6=Lotsa people outside Astrat think we lok intimidating and get scared, but we wear these outfits with pride\!
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.7=The peeps here in Astrat are really nice to us, we help 'em with a lotta things and they help us\! Give and take\!
Adventure.Punk.Beach.1=Hah, look at this view. Sucks to be the gang we got at the Glacial Pathways harharhar\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Beach.2=Myste Edun... such a pretty and clean beach. Wonder who the caretakers are?
Adventure.Punk.Beach.3=They apparently clean it up using robots and not a single person bro.
Adventure.Punk.Beach.4=What? I don't get it.
Adventure.Punk.Beach.5=The beach is nice... but I kinda don't wanna swim. I heard the sea is haunted by gigantic leviathans.
Adventure.Punk.Beach.6=Those are just rumors bro, tons of people go swimming here every day.
Adventure.Punk.Beach.7=Yeah, you're right\!\! I was just trying this "considering" thing Cress showed us\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.1=B-bro?
Adventure.Punk.Betray.2=I ain't your bro anymore\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.3=Hey nice hit bro\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.4=There are more to come.
Adventure.Punk.Betray.5=I've had it with this bro-talk\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.6=You silly punks\! The world can't go on like this forever\! Azure Shield is right\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.7=Get out of my way. It's time for me to join the agents.
Adventure.Punk.Betray.8=Why does Cress cling so to the past? It is time for a change\! My fists ache for the future\!
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.1=This whole place is confusing. Gears everywhere you look? I miss Astrat...
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.2=Ya know, there were always noises in this ol' factory, but never as many as now... Is it Azure's fault?
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.3=Yo, don't ya think this factory is gigantic? It might even be bigger than Everod or Harosh\!
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.4=The gears disturb some punks... but honestly all the clicking... and clacking... makes me sleepy... *snore*
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.5=We're just scoutin' out this place for Cress, once we're done we're gettin' the hell outta here.
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.6=Yo, this whole place is just too mechy for us Punks ya know? We like "to the point" kinda things way better\!
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.7=Preeeetty sure Azure is up to no good here. Beat some of 'em up for us if you see any yeah?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.1=Cress-sis\! I've got your coffee brewed and ready\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.10=What can I say? I think with my heart\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.11=Look at me I'm kicking with my fists\! ... Oh who am I kidding.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.12=Sister your hair looks like a cape.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.13=That's the idea.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.14=Oh.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.15=*I wonder if Delicias grunts talk to her like this...*
Adventure.Punk.Cress.16=Sis if you don't mind me asking... What is your goal in life?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.17=Oh. I should know that? Knowing that is essential to the mission?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.18=YOU SAY IT'S OK AND I SHOULD CALM DOWN?????
Adventure.Punk.Cress.2=...
Adventure.Punk.Cress.3=... Ok sorry. Next time I'll bring it in a cup and not in my... fists.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.4=Here are the beans you wanted Cress-sis\! Oh, you wanted liquid coffee?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.5=Here I juiced them with my fists for you\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.6=*CRUNCH\!*
Adventure.Punk.Cress.7="Delicious."
Adventure.Punk.Cress.8=I really admire how you punch with your feet\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.9=You are a dumbo.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.1=I am so glad we have a canteen around here, I'd seriously dry out without it.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.10=We ain't scared of those Agent grunts or progress... but it just don't sit right with us.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.11=People shouldn't have to suffer... for any reason\!
Adventure.Punk.Desert.12=Cress-sis made sure we all know what Azure Shield is up to. Know Midius...?
Adventure.Punk.Desert.13=That used to be a bustling city... and the incident back then will repeat if we don't stop Azure.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.2=Ey, it's hot here sure, but the thing that makes me sweat more is seeing those Azure grunts...
Adventure.Punk.Desert.3=Yo, wanna listen to a story my parents used to tell me 'bout this place?
Adventure.Punk.Desert.4=Want to listen to the story?
Adventure.Punk.Desert.5=So get this, apparently the desert is alive\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Desert.6=I know, I hear you sayin' "but how?". Lemme let you in on the secret...
Adventure.Punk.Desert.7=Ghosts\!\!\! OooooOooOOOO, spooky\!\!\! They haunt this 'ere place\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Desert.8=Ya know, thinkin' back it was probably just made-up stories to scare the kids away from comin' here.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.9=No probs, just don't blame me when you see 'em\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.1=This one really doesn't know what they want.
Adventure.Punk.Double.10=Onward\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.11=I'm angry at you for beating up my bros and sisters...
Adventure.Punk.Double.12=... But I can't stay mad at someone who can beat agents so elegantly\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.13=And that is exactly the problem.
Adventure.Punk.Double.14=Are you trying to come back to the Force?
Adventure.Punk.Double.15=Just passing through.
Adventure.Punk.Double.16=What is your end goal here buddy?
Adventure.Punk.Double.17=What is yours?
Adventure.Punk.Double.18=Finishing the mission.
Adventure.Punk.Double.19=There is more to life than that
Adventure.Punk.Double.2=You betrayed us... then Azure Shield... what are you now?
Adventure.Punk.Double.20=What the heck are you talking about.
Adventure.Punk.Double.3=My own thing\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.4=You beat up some Punks... then some Agents... you're just a criminal then I suppose?
Adventure.Punk.Double.5=Look it's a... person?
Adventure.Punk.Double.6=If you freeze a pond, and then heat it up... is it the same water as before or something entirely new?
Adventure.Punk.Double.7=I'll always do my thing\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.8=I get that but...
Adventure.Punk.Double.9=Up or down, left or right which is it traitor?
Adventure.Punk.Duel.1=Ah well, we'll take the L. And you can take this\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.10=Punching punching... always punching. How about... punchering?
Adventure.Punk.Duel.11=Will this struggle ever end...? Just kidding, let's keep it up. Have a bonus\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.12=Stronger than you thought huh? Get some power first before you challenge us again.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.13=Hah, that wasn't even a warm-up\! Was that all you got?
Adventure.Punk.Duel.14=Word of advice\: Try hitting me with your attacks.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.15=Friendly reminder\: Dodge attacks.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.16=Oof ok, I did not need to go all out like that I suppose. Sorry.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.17=Oh no, wasn't I supposed to fight back?
Adventure.Punk.Duel.18=Ey bro no problem, I didn't know that this would be your first real fight\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.19=That really hit the spot\! Kinda gettin' hungry now.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.2=Good match\! Phew, I'm all tired out... Here's a reward for winning\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.20=I could do this all day\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.21=That was a great warm-up\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.22=Hey, watch it\! Oh\! Brozu\! You wanna show us some noise busting techniques? Let's go\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.23=Ah Brozu, you want a fight? Then let's fight\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.24=AGH\! A surprise attack, you got us again Cress-sis\! We won't let our guard down again, now let's brawl\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.25=OH NO\! She's angry\! Get ready for a beating everyone...\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.26=Oh uh sorry... I want to test out some battle techniques Spark taught me...
Adventure.Punk.Duel.27=AH\! We know that gal... ok boy, let's battle\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.28=LETS DUEL\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.29=Hey man I've been having a rough day, and I do not appreciate us getting sucker punched by somebody I like.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.3=Darn I was aiming for the K.O. I mean... I was heading for the head.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.30=Oh no, I'm so sorry.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.31=I'm just playin', let's fight\!

Adventure.Punk.Duel.33=Hi Spark, nice attack. Could use some practice though.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.34=Nice use of that VOC\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.35=*Dang that wasn't intentional... eh let's make it look like it was*
Adventure.Punk.Duel.36=Let's see what they taught you at that monastery of yours\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.37=*Mainly not to attack without reason... whooops*
Adventure.Punk.Duel.38=Hey give me a gift.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.39=... Eeeeeeaaarn iiiiiiit I guess???
Adventure.Punk.Duel.4=This was supposed to be a friendly fight... but now I feel we are more than friends.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.5=The way you move... it makes me feel home. Thank you.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.6=Ey nice fight, have this\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.7=I stole this from an Agent hehe. Hide it for me will ya.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.8=Look what I found between my abs\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.9=If you do enough push ups... the push up fairy will come and give you this\!
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.1=What made you change sides?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.10=She owes me five bucks\!
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.2=After fighting the Punks over and over again...
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.3=...I just realised that we're not ready yet to embark into an uncertain future.
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.4=Right on, dude\!
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.5=Sooo... what are the Azure Shield headquarters like?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.6=You want to know secret pathways or some passwords?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.7=Actually I just wanted to know if their HQ is heated... because ours ain't.
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.8=Ever met Del? What's she like?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.9=She's a good leader... I think... What is Cress like?
Adventure.Punk.Forest.1=You just gotta love the sounds of Nature, I just wish there were more animals...
Adventure.Punk.Forest.2=Ey, heard of the rumors? People are sayin' that almost all animals here were... eaten by Noises... sheesh\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.3=Takin' a hike like this, beatin' up noises and searching for lost treasure to help people... I LOVE BEING A PUNK\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.4=Punchin' trees... that's what it's all about baby.
Adventure.Punk.Forest.5=Have you considered joinin' the punks? The test is easy, just beat one or two of us up while Cress watches\! HAHAHA\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.6=Cress is amazing, she teaches us a lotta new things\! Like... waiting to see what VOCs the enemy has before attacking\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.7=Before Cress rose to the top, we had strong punks like Flink tellin' us the drill... We're all happier now though\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.1=We have two motives in Crimson Force\: helping those in need and to stop Azure. If the going gets tough, turn to us\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.2=Oughta be careful round here, don't want any Azures to find our hideout... AGH, forget you heard anything\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.3=A lotta punks were sus of Cress leadin' us, but she proved that she's more of a punk than any of us\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.4=Yo, it's so cold here. Can't imagine how much colder it must be for those hot-climate-agents though.
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.5=Everod sure is tough. Just imagine, it snows here all-year long\! Where does all that even come from??
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.6=Being here makes me wish I'd be in the sunny beaches of Myste Edun instead... man.
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.7=I actually prefer the cold. It gives me a reason to wear my Cress socks...
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.8=Yeah of course I can knit you a pair\! Oh you didn't ask? That's ok I'll do it anyway.
Adventure.Punk.Ice.1=You know, for this being an ice-cave it sure feels warm. Gotta wonder why.
Adventure.Punk.Ice.2=All servers here are cooled by the ice, so we don't gotta pay for cooling\! ...Cress-sis is so smart\!
Adventure.Punk.Ice.3=Don't forget, shhhhhh\! Don't tell anyone about our hideout.
Adventure.Punk.Ice.4=Hideout? What hideout?
Adventure.Punk.Ice.5=I don't know\! What are you talking about?\!
Adventure.Punk.Ice.6=What are YOU talking about?\!
Adventure.Punk.Join.1=I'd love to be part of your squad and all but I'd feel like the third wheel.
Adventure.Punk.Join.2=Invite this punk to your party?
Adventure.Punk.Join.3=Aw yeah\!
Adventure.Punk.Join.4=Man, I'm super bored. Wish I could switch posts...
Adventure.Punk.Join.5=If you were a Punk too I could go adventuring with you... Ah well\!
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.1=Wait... did you turn on your own gang? That's cold dude.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.2=So you want to be a punk? Well I don't see any reason not to trust you.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.3=I'll let you join us... IF you write a theme song for me.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.4=What is Cress's policy on Azure recruits? Oh, she says we'll take what we can get? 
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.5=Hey wanna join us?
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.6=YES FINALLY\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.7=No ew you smell.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.8=... So?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.1=How do I take on a giant QT?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.10=Easy. The noise of a waffle maker.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.11=... I meant the digital ghost thingies.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.12=... Yeah me too. Gotta go\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.13=Cress has been going out more often to fight Noises on her own.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.14=She's training on her own.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.15=Well you said that we should always be prepared for a Noise attack\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.16=*But at this rate she'll be more useful than me...*
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.17=Ey, who do you prefer? Spark or Cress?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.18=I don't understand the question.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.19=I mean who would you rather spar with?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.2=A... giant?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.20=Oh uh Spark I guess. Cress' kicks are a bit much for me.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.21=Tell me about it
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.22=What are Noise Hunter girls like?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.23=Uh... they're OK.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.24=Just asking cause I'm thinking of settling down and leading a cozy Noise Hunter lifestyle.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.25=Believe me, there's nothing cozy about it.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.26=*I do miss Snow Waffles though*
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.27=So what ARE Noises?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.28=I told you last lesson.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.29=You did? Dang\! Why can't I remember\!?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.3=Yeah you know, those have been popping up from time to time.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.30=Hey Rozu can you lend me a scarf?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.31=Sorry, I lost mine yesterday.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.32=Hehe, that's a pity.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.4=... Same way you beat a normal QT but... with bigger attacks?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.5=Wow\! Thanks Bro\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.6=How many Noises have you taken on in your time?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.7=Uh... millions\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.8=OH BOY\!

Adventure.Punk.Socks.1=Yo, you already have some Cress socks? Wow, you're a real fan too huh\!?
Adventure.Punk.Socks.2=I hope these socks will help you be as fast as Cress\! I put lots of love into them\!
Adventure.Punk.Spark.1=Eey Spark-Girl what's poppin, ready to rumble? Yabadoodledeezle\!
Adventure.Punk.Spark.10=What about "punching Agents" ain't real?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.11=I see how you're trying to get stronger than Cress. But between us two...
Adventure.Punk.Spark.12=It's no coincidence she's our boss.
Adventure.Punk.Spark.13=Sooo you and that Fin guyyy are you two... interested in buying official Punk merch or nah?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.14=Are you still fighting crimes in the streets?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.15=...Oh, it's what we're all doing right now? Wait, where am I???
Adventure.Punk.Spark.16=You know what I appreciate about you Spark? You're just as dumb as us\!
Adventure.Punk.Spark.17=Rude?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.18=Rozu said you'd find it funny.
Adventure.Punk.Spark.19=Ey sister, where should we hide Rozu's scarf?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.2=... Did I say something wrong? Still trying to get into the Punk spirit...
Adventure.Punk.Spark.20=His scarf?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.21=Yeah, you told us to steal it from him as a prank.
Adventure.Punk.Spark.22=... Oh yeah I did. I dunno give it to an Agent, they look cold.

Adventure.Punk.Spark.7=... What do you mean he's not that strong?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.8=Sooo are you also just doing this to punch some Agents?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.9=No, I've got real reasons.
Adventure.Punk.Tower.1=Another day, another surprise. The life of a Punk is never boring\!

Adventure.RAgent.Del.3=I do not care. If you stand in our way... I'll take care of you.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.4=A fair warning. You won't win this fight.

Agent.3.1=I'm already late. If I don't\nhurry they- oh no.
Agent.3.10=Wait\!
Agent.3.11=Oh no... What do\nI tell Cress?
Agent.3.2=Ha HA\! I reached it first\!
Agent.3.3=Noo... wait. Doesn't Crimson\nForce have different outfits?
Agent.3.4=A Noise Hunter always\nstays in his uniform.
Agent.3.5=Whatever that means... Anyways, you\nneed to step away from that thing buddy,\nbecause I really need to blow it up.
Agent.3.6=I will stop you\! In the\nname of Crimson Justice\!
Agent.3.7=Yes\! I did it\!
Agent.3.8=You still haven't defeated me\!
Agent.3.9=Well that was never part of my\nmission\! I'm done here, see ya\!
Agent.4.1=Fin? What a coincidence\!
Agent.4.10=She's running late\nagain so... sure\!
Agent.4.11=Was nice hanging out with you pal\!\nGotta hurry now\!
Agent.4.12=See ya\!
Agent.4.13=Did you just defeat an\nAzure Shield member?\nThat's really cool man.
Agent.4.14=Oh... yup\! I totally did\!
Agent.4.15=Then I guess I won't have\nto hold back anymore\! Hehe.
Agent.4.16=Yeah.
Agent.4.17=(Uh-oh)
Agent.4.2=Charles? Wow I didn't\nrecognize you in that...\noutfit.
Agent.4.3=Oh, do you like it? I'm\nactually on my work to\na mission right now.
Agent.4.4=Isn't Azure Shield\nkinda... weird?
Agent.4.5=Uh, I don't think so. They pay\nwell and I feel like I'm doing\nsomething good for the world\!
Agent.4.6=I don't know about that...
Agent.4.7=... Hey listen. I can see that you\ndon't want to talk about this\nstuff, so... What are you up to?
Agent.4.8=Waiting for my date.\nWe're gonna train a bit.
Agent.4.9=Like with VOCs? Hey do you want to\nlearn some tricks I picked up at work?\nI bet you could impress them with those.
Agent.5.1=Agent, how many troops\ndo we have left?
Agent.5.10=Well WE made it in time.
Agent.5.11=Were you behind all this?
Agent.5.12=Destroy it immediately so\nthat no new Noises will be\nable to spawn. Good luck.
Agent.5.2=They're all severly wounded,\nI'm the only one left\!
Agent.5.3=Crimson Force has blocked the\nteleportation pathways, so until\nreinforcements arrive it is up to...
Agent.5.4=you to stop the Noise outbreak. You\nneed to enter the factory and reach\nthe central Voxel Generator.
Agent.5.5=I did it\! But there are still Noises\nspilling out into the streets...
Agent.5.6=The heroes have come\nto save the day\!
Agent.5.7=Huh?
Agent.5.8=It's Cress\!
Agent.5.9="Heroes"? Because of you, our\ntroops couldn't make it in time.
Agent.6.1=There is no need\nfor violence now.
Agent.6.10=... What?
Agent.6.11=Agent\! We need you\noutside immediately\!
Agent.6.12=What is going on???
Agent.6.13=The real battle is\nabout to begin.
Agent.6.2=M-ms. Del\!
Agent.6.3=You are Delicia right?\nCress told me about you.
Agent.6.4=...
Agent.6.5=Why are you doing this?\nDoesn't Crimson Force\nwant the same thing as us?
Agent.6.6=Look buddy, you're clearly in the\nwrong here. This is no ordinary\nfactory and you know it.
Agent.6.7=... Agent, I shall leave\nthis one to you.\nSomething's not right here.
Agent.6.8=Let's rock n' roll\!
Agent.6.9=Oh... welp, I was just supposed to\ndistract you. See ya\!

Punk.10=So, who made you our new boss?
Punk.100=I'VE HAD IT COME 'ERE LEMME PUNCH YA WHOEVER COMES NEXT\!\!\!
Punk.101=Alright\! I'll be first to reach that thing\! Cress-sis will be proud of me\!
Punk.102=Huh?
Punk.103=REPORTING A HUGE-
Punk.104=AAAAAARGHG\!\!\!
Punk.105=Any of you find an entry?
Punk.106=Nope, they really don't want anyone snooping around there.
Punk.107=Some skimpy blue guys were walking the grounds. They were kinda hot.
Punk.108=Did ya fight them?
Punk.109=Ye we fought them.
Punk.11=I did after I beat all of you fair and square.
Punk.110=Hey. Has anyone seen Puppy?
Punk.111=Where is that silly rambling mess?
Punk.112=Her signal is gone...
Punk.113=HEY\!
Punk.114=GET AWAY FROM HERE\!
Punk.115=MAKE US\!
Punk.116=WATCH OUT\!\!\!
Punk.12=I don't trust ya, you're just some chick.
Punk.13=Well tough luck, if you want to stay part of the Punks you'll have to listen to this chick.
Punk.14=What are we even doing here? This place is weird.
Punk.15=Scared?
Punk.16=Annoyed.
Punk.17=Listen Flink. You're the strongest of the gang. I know a lot of you are sceptical about my goals...
Punk.18=WHAT are we doing exactly? You never talk about what you're planning. Why should we trust you?
Punk.19=It's no right to say this as a Punk but... being a better fighter doesn't make you stand above us\!
Punk.2=Ey\! You talking to me?
Punk.20=Calm down Flink.
Punk.21=No\! That's it. Ya sucker punched us last time, but now I'm prepared. I'll settle this right now\!
Punk.22=... but trust me. I'm doing this for us all.
Punk.23=What?\! Oh what, no uh... I...
Punk.24=Brozu... please.
Punk.25=I'm telling you I barely know the basics...
Punk.26=Y'are the ONLY guy 'ere who can do it, we need your help. For Cress... sis.
Punk.27=Cress really hurt herself out there didn't she...
Punk.28=That ugly monster-thing did it\!
Punk.29=Noises aren't monsters they're just... data.
Punk.3=No\! But you're talking to me\!
Punk.30=... I talked back at her and still she protected me. She's still recovering from that... she's a proper Punk.
Punk.31=... I know a place where we can train.
Punk.32=So what are we supposed to do?
Punk.33=Well Noises are just jammed together data. There used to be an ice-cream factory and a petting zoo here sooo...
Punk.34=There he is.
Punk.35=He?
Punk.36=Uh "it" we call them Alexsanders.
Punk.37=What do I do?
Punk.38=Observe its pattern, that is the first rule. Noises are programs, they don't adapt...
Punk.39=... they have one fixed moveset they always use. Observe and... STRIKE FIRST\!
Punk.4=Ey\! I was talking\!
Punk.40=You did it\! Of course there are advanced techniques and strategies for every single Noise out there...
Punk.41=... but now you understand the basics\!
Punk.42=Brozu, can you teach me too?
Punk.43=And me?
Punk.44=How about us??
Punk.45=Whoa, whoa\! Let the man enjoy his coffee first.
Punk.46=What's this about coffee?
Punk.47=CRESS-SIS?\!
Punk.48=Once you understand that, something like this shouldn't happen again.
Punk.49=Gang, let's talk.
Punk.5=No\! It was me that was talking\!
Punk.50=Is it about tha plan?
Punk.51=What plan?
Punk.52=There's a plan?
Punk.53=There's a plan.
Punk.54=Let's talk about the plan.
Punk.55=What is... a plan?
Punk.56=It is... when you do more than just punch a thing to solve your problems.
Punk.57=Shooting is also ok, you see?
Punk.58=... LISTEN\! We're going on a trip. Not all of you, just the strongest ones and Rozu.
Punk.59=Uhm...
Punk.6=I DON'T THINK SO BUDDY\!
Punk.60=You're our Noise expert dummy. We need you on this one.
Punk.61=We'll go near Harosh not far from here. There have been way more Noise sightings than usual there...
Punk.62=... and I suspect D-... Azure Shield has something to do with it.
Punk.63=That posh tech-company?
Punk.64=Yeah. I've seen them work with Noises before and I don't like it.
Punk.65=Work WITH Noises? That... wait I've seen that before\!
Punk.66=A hot-... I mean a guy dressed for HOT climate was running around the Glacial Pathways with 2 Greeds\!
Punk.67=Doesn't bode well does it? The other team will go to Arahas Desert.
Punk.68=A what?
Punk.69=Trust me it's better not to know right now.  
Punk.7=BUDDY? BUDDY???
Punk.70=Enter the site, don't get too close to the giant monster-looking thing...
Punk.71=UNDERSTOOD\!
Punk.72=THEN LET'S GO\!
Punk.73=Cress why didn't you go with the other team? This seems like a really chill... hike?
Punk.74=I want Azure Shield to concentrate their attention and security on their desert project for now.
Punk.75=There is no way we can stop what they're doing... not when they have some means of producing Noises.
Punk.76=THAT'S what they're doing?
Punk.77=It's what I suspect. And I suspect it a lot. So we need to stop that.
Punk.78=Cress-sis. Something is following us. Don't like it. Is it a good plan to, uh, punch it...?
Punk.79=That is a very good plan, yes.
Punk.8=You uh, wanna grab some grub?
Punk.80=Thank\! You\!
Punk.81=Do you think they've noticed us?
Punk.82=No way. Look at those meatbags, they don't notice anything.
Punk.83=FELLAS, I've got a plan\!
Punk.84=Plans are fun\!
Punk.85=Hey, what did I miss?
Punk.86=They... they built a Noise factory\!
Punk.87=This will require one hell of a plan...
Punk.88=... and leave immediately. Make it look like you're just doing... punk stuff.
Punk.89=Azure Shield is working on something there. All I want you to do is create some ruckus there.
Punk.9=Absolutely\!
Punk.90=Ya heard Cress\! Let's crush their camp from multiple sites\!
Punk.91=What if we get caught?
Punk.92=Well Puppy what do ya usually do when someone does something you don't like?
Punk.93=Shoot VOCs with my knuckles?
Punk.94=And what are ya gonna do when somebody is trying to catch ya?
Punk.95=Oh\! I get it now\! Punches\! Thanks big sis\!
Punk.96=Spread out and meet up back 'ere in 2 hours\!
Punk.97=Aye\!
Punk.98=Brozu prepared me for this\!
Punk.99=Oh. Okay. For Cress-sis\!

Rozu.1=Aaah, the beautiful Bombarbara.\nWhat curves, what a smile,\nwhat a temperament...
Rozu.2=Ladies.
Rozu.3=These Gals have been popping up more\nand more lately... Well the more Noises I\ndefeat the faster I can get back home.
Rozu.3.1=A QT... I remember one of your kind is responsible for... ugh\!
Rozu.3.2=... Good.
Rozu.4=Watch out\!
Rozu.4.1=Hey\! Why aren't they attacking you?\!
Rozu.4.2=Let's say... we trained them.
Rozu.4.3=You shouldn't be doing this.
Rozu.4.4=It's all good man. We do what we do\nfor the greater good. You're a Noise\nHunter aren't you?
Rozu.4.5=Don't you want Noises and\nhumans to live in harmony?
Rozu.4.6=This cannot bring any good\!\nWe... we guard the roads\!
Rozu.5=Phew that was close.\nSofas just looove sinking their teeth\ninto human butts I tell ya\!
Rozu.5.1=Go away\! Away\!
Rozu.5.2=Hey you, wake up.
Rozu.5.3=Mo... mom?
Rozu.5.4=Whoa\! Slow down there buddy...
Rozu.5.5=No, actually we'll never get to the\n"calling me mom" base. But uh...\njust get him somewhere warm guys\!
Rozu.5.6=YES MA'AM\!
Rozu.5.7=Are we going home?
Rozu.5.8=That's up to you.\nI'm Cress by the way.
Rozu.5.9=Noise Hunter Rule \#1\:\nThere is always home.
Rozu.6=... Sooo... I'm Rozu\!\nDo you come here often?
Rozu.7=... Ok.
Sarah=Sarah
Shop.Agent.1=Love using my keytar VOC generator. Let's buy some ammunition.
Shop.Agent.10=Oh yeah. This'll do the trick.
Shop.Agent.11=But does it fit my outfit?
Shop.Agent.12=Is this VOC part of the official Azure Shield collection?
Shop.Agent.13=Are Agents supposed to use this VOC? I'm sure nobody will mind.
Shop.Agent.14=Does this fit my style?
Shop.Agent.2=Our budget recently increased. Let's use it wisely.
Shop.Agent.3=To achieve your dreams you need to prepare properly.
Shop.Agent.4=These VOCS are totally pianissimo\! If you know what I mean.
Shop.Agent.5=A stylish Agent needs some stylish VOCs\!
Shop.Agent.6=That's hot.
Shop.Agent.7=Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Those Punks won't know what hit them.
Shop.Agent.8=I love the sound this VOC makes.
Shop.Agent.9=This VOC deserves its own theme song.
Shop.Bella.1=I could really go for some cheesecake right now.
Shop.Bella.2=We must protect the people of Luna\!
Shop.Bella.3=Let's gear up for battle\!
Shop.Bella.4=I think that was a good decision\!
Shop.Bella.5=This will come in handy when battling Murks\!
Shop.Bella.6=Money well spent\!
Shop.Bella.7=I hope we can solve things without violence... but I'll need to protect myself.
Shop.Bella.8=Should I really buy this... instead of cheesecake bars?
Shop.Cress.1=Delicia invented VOCs... and I will use them against her.
Shop.Cress.10=I'd love to throw this in Del's face.
Shop.Cress.11=Wonder if Azure Shield is developing their own VOCs?
Shop.Cress.12=I really should stop losing my VOCs all the time... eh I've got enough cash.
Shop.Cress.13=Back in the day we had no need for VOCs... must've been weird.
Shop.Cress.14=100% sure about this?
Shop.Cress.2=Need to stack up on VOCS. Just in case I lose them again.
Shop.Cress.3=I COULD use some new rocket boots...but VOCs are more important right now I guess.
Shop.Cress.4=OK\! VOC TIME\! ...But maybe another coffee first?
Shop.Cress.5=I sometimes hear Spark murmuring my name while shopping... Oh wow\! I'm doing the same right now.
Shop.Cress.6=From archeologist to frequent VOC shopper. What is my life?
Shop.Cress.7=This'll make an impact\!
Shop.Cress.8=A punk used this one against me... couldn't land it though.
Shop.Cress.9=1,2,3 the baddest punk is me\!
Shop.Del.1=Do I make Bits by buying my own invention?
Shop.Del.10=Maybe someday I'll go back to developing VOCs like these.
Shop.Del.11=Is this necessary for my arsenal?
Shop.Del.12=I like this one... it has a cute design.
Shop.Del.13=I clearly remember who inspired me to program this one... hope she'll talk to me again someday
Shop.Del.2=Keep losing track of how many VOCs I've programmed... maybe there are some I've forgotten entirely?
Shop.Del.3=I hear young developers are creating their own VOCs... these are some very exciting times.
Shop.Del.4=Maybe I could teach others how to code new VOCS someday... until then I'll buy what I can get.
Shop.Del.5=I remember coding this one.
Shop.Del.6=A fine VOC. Could use an upgrade though.
Shop.Del.7=Worth the Ebits.
Shop.Del.8=Could this VOC be useful outside of combat?
Shop.Del.9=This will help us achieve our goals.
Shop.Fin.1=Better safe than ready\! ...Wait.
Shop.Fin.10=Am I sure that I want to spend my Ebits for this?
Shop.Fin.11=Am I positive that I can't just use one of Dads old Vocs instead of this?
Shop.Fin.12=JUST BUY IT ALREADY... wait do I really deserve this though?
Shop.Fin.13=
Shop.Fin.2=Buying VOCs is so exciting\! I can't wait to study them someday.
Shop.Fin.3=I've been saving up for this shopping spree\! ...I'll only buy the essentials.
Shop.Fin.4=This'll make a great gift for Spark\!
Shop.Fin.5=Hope I won't need to use that one... but you never know.
Shop.Fin.6=Am I splurging too much?
Shop.Fin.7=I shouldn't use too many Bits... but i guess it's OK to use them for VOCs... sometimes.
Shop.Fin.8=Guess I'll just skip breakfast tomorrow... and the rest of the week.
Shop.Fin.9=Mom always said that it's okay to treat yourself sometimes... not that she ever did though.
Shop.Punk.1=Punching is great\! But sometimes you need something... punchier.
Shop.Punk.10=This VOC'll make Cress notice me for sure.
Shop.Punk.11=Now what is the right balance between using VOCs and using your muscles?
Shop.Punk.12=WHOA, that one was expensive. I think. Not sure how money works.
Shop.Punk.13=Is this somethin' I really want?
Shop.Punk.2=Cress says we need to stock up on VOCs. I wonder if I can buy a second pair of fists though.
Shop.Punk.3=You gotta make money to... punch Agents better.
Shop.Punk.4=Yo. Yo Yo Yo. Azure Shield won't like that one.
Shop.Punk.5=I'd love to someday be able to fight just using my fists... but until then this'll be useful.
Shop.Punk.6=Can I combine this with a punch?
Shop.Punk.7=Maybe after the conflict with Azure Shield is over I could learn to develop VOCs myself?
Shop.Punk.8=Dope.
Shop.Punk.9=I can just imagine blasting this one while infiltrating an Azure Base\!
Shop.Rozu.1=Time to shop to make Azure Shield... stop? ...Look at me I'm a Punk.
Shop.Rozu.10=Noises hate this one. Maybe I should buy another.
Shop.Rozu.11=Hmm... should I really buy this?
Shop.Rozu.12=Am I compensating for getting kicked out of my home and feeling a sense of worthelessness? ... yeah maybe but this VOC is good for swatting Agents.
Shop.Rozu.13=Spark used this one to beat me yesterday... maybe I can learn from that.
Shop.Rozu.2=I need to be ready in case some Noises come to town.
Shop.Rozu.3=Back home I was only allowed to use so many Vocs... this will be so much fun\!
Shop.Rozu.4=I wonder what other VOC would go well with this...
Shop.Rozu.5=I remember seeing another Hunter using this one\!
Shop.Rozu.6=I need to be careful with that\!
Shop.Rozu.7=No better way to spend my money...
Shop.Rozu.8=With this I'll beat Spark for sure.
Shop.Rozu.9=I wonder how many VOCs the average Punk uses?
Shop.Spark.1=Hoho\! Let's burn some cash.
Shop.Spark.10=NICE. This'll annoy the agents for sure\!
Shop.Spark.11=This is what Ebits are for. I wonder if Cress will ever pay me?
Shop.Spark.12=Been meaning to find a Voc that I could beat Cress with.
Shop.Spark.13=I probably don't NEED this VOC to beat the Agents... but why not have a little fun\!
Shop.Spark.14=Am I positive I can't find this VOC inside of my soul?
Shop.Spark.15=Do I want to own this VOC? Can one really own anything in this world?
Shop.Spark.16=Excess is poison for the soul. But this VOC'll surely be poison to Azure Shield as well hehe.
Shop.Spark.2=Tree-monks aren't really allowed to own money... better spend it then\!
Shop.Spark.3=My master back home wouldn't like me dabbling in shops... Guess there are perks to getting out of there\!
Shop.Spark.4=I'm probably stronger than Cress already... Won't hurt to expand my arsenal though.
Shop.Spark.5=Maybe there are some VOCs that will catch Cress off-guard? ...Oh and the Agents of course. Focus.
Shop.Spark.6=Ah someday I'll show this VOC to Mastress.
Shop.Spark.7=I've been looking for that\!
Shop.Spark.8=Wonder what this'll do?
Shop.Spark.9=This'll fit my fighting style.
Shop.TriWing.1=FUEL LEVELS... OK\! SHOPPING ENGAGED\!

Spark.3=Ms. Spark has won our\nmonthly tournament... again\!
Spark.3.1=Protecting that civilian... I wish I could do\nsomething useful like this more often.\nTournaments are a waste of time...
Spark.3.10=Yes... that's exactly the reason\nI wanted to talk to you.\nPlease teach me how to fight\!
Spark.3.11=... Sure. I don't have anything\nelse to do right now. \nImma crush you 3 times\nGive ya a bit of an edge\!
Spark.3.12=Dang this must seem creepy sorry. I'll leave you alone.
Spark.3.2=Hey\!
Spark.3.3=Oh. Hey? Were you following me?
Spark.3.4=No, no\! Uh... It's just a coincidence\! I didn't even know you lived in Everod...
Spark.3.5=Are you... ok?
Spark.3.6=Ouch\! But I think \nI'm getting the hang of this\!
Spark.3.7=Practice makes perfect\!\nC'mon let's try again.
Spark.3.8=Yes, I'm ok now. Thanks to you.\nIf you hadn't helped me back there...
Spark.3.9=Yo, these are dangerous times.\nYou better learn to fight for yourself.
Spark.4=The prize money will get me\nthrough the next month... phew\!
Spark.4.1=Whoa\! Almost had me there for a second.\nYou're really motivated aren't you?
Spark.4.10=...
Spark.4.11=Oh no\! It's already late\! Sorry, but I gotta get to adam\!
Spark.4.2=Yes... I need to be able to\nprotect my little brother.\nI'm all he has left.
Spark.4.3=... Where do you guys live?
Spark.4.4=You know those Crimson Force guys?\nThey opened a foster home just outside\nof town. We're staying there.
Spark.4.5=Oh man.
Spark.4.6=It's pretty cool actually. But I'm saving up, so I can buy us our own hou-
Spark.4.7=He seems... overprotective. But\nat least he's got a goal... ugh.\nSpark what are you doing to\nyourself.
Spark.4.8=Noises again\! How do they keep entering\nthis city?
Spark.4.9=You won't hurt any civilians on my watch\!\nI am Spark, the protector of Everod\!\!
Spark.5=Yup, that just paid\nfor barely enough food...
Spark.5.1=That guy from yesterday said he'd\nlike to train again today. That's the\nfoster home? Wait a second...
Spark.5.2=Hey\!
Spark.5.3=What are two Azure Shield\nAgents doing behind a\nCrimson Force foster home?
Spark.5.4=N-nothing?
Spark.5.5=I know your organization wants to harm Crimson Force, but don't even think about it\!
Spark.5.6=Let's get out of here\!\nShe's crazy\!
Spark.5.7=Another day, another good deed\!
Spark.5.8=
Spark.5.9=Because I am the protector of this town\!
Spark.6=Uh, excuse me Ms. Spark?
Spark.6.1=Being a vigilante sure is fun...\nbut it doesn't pay my rent...\nSo let's go again\!
Spark.6.2=No\! How am I supposed to get\nthrough the month now?\!
Spark.6.3=You have taken out some Azure\nShield guys in Everod right?
Spark.6.4=Yeah?
Spark.6.5=You're reckless, but pretty good.\nHave you ever thought about\nworking for Crimson Force?
