Agent.1.1=Ok Vanessa, you can do this.\nYou can do this...
Agent.1.10=... That's exactly right.\nLet's start your exam.\nGood luck\!
Agent.1.11=Congratulations\!
Agent.1.12=You're now a full-fledged Azure Agent\!
Agent.1.13=Thank you\! I hope\nI can be of service\!
Agent.1.14=Of course. You will\nstart immediately\!
Agent.1.2=Standard procedure\nwith this one?
Agent.1.3=Looks like it.
Agent.1.4=H-hi\!
Agent.1.5=Hello. Let's get right to it.
Agent.1.6=Before you can join us, you\nneed to prove your skills.
Agent.1.7=But first, tell us why you\nwant to be one of us.
Agent.1.8=My... our world is suffering\! There just\naren't enough resources... if Azure Shield\nsucceeds we can help everyone\!
Agent.1.9=We can provide infinite food\nand water to everyone\!
Agent.2.1=So... why are we here?
Agent.2.10=Aren't we just the best couple\nAzure Shield has ever seen?
Agent.2.11=Hahahahaha\!
Agent.2.2=Did you not listen to\nthe general again?\nYou're the worst\!
Agent.2.3=C'mon just tell me. Without\nme you won't be able to\nfinish this job either.
Agent.2.4=It's a simple scouting mission.\nIt's best if you don't get\ninvolved, so just stay behind...
Agent.2.5=No reason to be rude.
Agent.2.6=Shoot\!\nI knew we should've\ndisguised ourselves\!
Agent.2.7=Jess are you ok?\nYou look hurt.
Agent.2.8=Ouch\! It's... we started\nbickering again, instead\nof preparing for the job.
Agent.2.9=... Classic Jess\nand Sarah eh?
Agent.3.1=I'm already late. If I don't\nhurry they- oh no.
Agent.3.10=Wait\!
Agent.3.11=Oh no... What do\nI tell Cress?
Agent.3.2=Ha HA\! I reached it first\!
Agent.3.3=Noo... wait. Doesn't Crimson\nForce have different outfits?
Agent.3.4=A Noise Hunter always\nstays in his uniform.
Agent.3.5=Whatever that means... Anyways, you\nneed to step away from that thing buddy,\nbecause I really need to blow it up.
Agent.3.6=I will stop you\! In the\nname of Crimson Justice\!
Agent.3.7=Yes\! I did it\!
Agent.3.8=You still haven't defeated me\!
Agent.3.9=Well that was never part of my\nmission\! I'm done here, see ya\!
Agent.4.1=Fin? What a coincidence\!
Agent.4.10=She's running late\nagain so... sure\!
Agent.4.11=Was nice hanging out with you pal\!\nGotta hurry now\!
Agent.4.12=See ya\!
Agent.4.13=Did you just defeat an\nAzure Shield member?\nThat's really cool man.
Agent.4.14=Oh... yup\! I totally did\!
Agent.4.15=Then I guess I won't have\nto hold back anymore\! Hehe.
Agent.4.16=Yeah.
Agent.4.17=(Uh-oh)
Agent.4.2=Charles? Wow I didn't\nrecognize you in that...\noutfit.
Agent.4.3=Oh, do you like it? I'm\nactually on my work to\na mission right now.
Agent.4.4=Isn't Azure Shield\nkinda... weird?
Agent.4.5=Uh, I don't think so. They pay\nwell and I feel like I'm doing\nsomething good for the world\!
Agent.4.6=I don't know about that...
Agent.4.7=... Hey listen. I can see that you\ndon't want to talk about this\nstuff, so... What are you up to?
Agent.4.8=Waiting for my date.\nWe're gonna train a bit.
Agent.4.9=Like with VOCs? Hey do you want to\nlearn some tricks I picked up at work?\nI bet you could impress them with those.
Agent.5.1=Agent, how many troops\ndo we have left?
Agent.5.10=Well WE made it in time.
Agent.5.11=Were you behind all this?
Agent.5.12=Destroy it immediately so\nthat no new Noises will be\nable to spawn. Good luck.
Agent.5.2=They're all severly wounded,\nI'm the only one left\!
Agent.5.3=Crimson Force has blocked the\nteleportation pathways, so until\nreinforcements arrive it is up to...
Agent.5.4=you to stop the Noise outbreak. You\nneed to enter the factory and reach\nthe central Voxel Generator.
Agent.5.5=I did it\! But there are still Noises\nspilling out into the streets...
Agent.5.6=The heroes have come\nto save the day\!
Agent.5.7=Huh?
Agent.5.8=It's Cress\!
Agent.5.9="Heroes"? Because of you, our\ntroops couldn't make it in time.
Agent.6.1=There is no need\nfor violence now.
Agent.6.10=... What?
Agent.6.11=Agent\! We need you\noutside immediately\!
Agent.6.12=What is going on???
Agent.6.13=The real battle is\nabout to begin.
Agent.6.2=M-ms. Del\!
Agent.6.3=You are Delicia right?\nCress told me about you.
Agent.6.4=...
Agent.6.5=Why are you doing this?\nDoesn't Crimson Force\nwant the same thing as us?
Agent.6.6=Look buddy, you're clearly in the\nwrong here. This is no ordinary\nfactory and you know it.
Agent.6.7=... Agent, I shall leave\nthis one to you.\nSomething's not right here.
Agent.6.8=Let's rock n' roll\!
Agent.6.9=Oh... welp, I was just supposed to\ndistract you. See ya\!

Punk.101=Alright\! I'll be first to reach that thing\! Cress will be proud of me\!
Punk.102=Huh?
Punk.103=NO\!\!\!
Punk.104=AAAAAARGHG\!\!\!
Punk.105=Any of you find an entry?
Punk.106=Nope, they really don't want anyone snooping around there.
Punk.107=Some skimpy blue guys were walking the grounds. They were kinda hot.
Punk.108=Did ya fight them?
Punk.109=Ye we fought them.
Punk.11=I did after I beat all of you fair and square.
Punk.110=Hey. Has anyone seen Puppy?
Punk.111=Where is that silly rambling mess?
Punk.112=Her signal is gone...
Punk.113=HEY\!
Punk.114=GET AWAY FROM HERE\!
Punk.115=MAKE US\!
Punk.116=Watch out\!\!\!
Punk.12=I don't trust ya, you're just some chick.
Punk.13=Well tough luck, if you want to stay part of the Punks you'll have to listen to this chick.
Punk.14=What are we even doing here? This place is weird.
Punk.15=Scared?
Punk.16=Annoyed.
Punk.17=Listen Flink. You're the strongest of the gang. I know a lot of you are sceptical about my goals...
Punk.18=WHAT are we doing exactly? You never talk about what you're planning. Why should we trust you?
Punk.19=It's no right to say this as a Punk but... being a better fighter doesn't make you stand above us\!
Punk.2=Ey\! You talking to me?
Punk.20=Calm down Flink.
Punk.21=No\! That's it. Ya sucker punched us last time, but now I'm prepared. I'll settle this right now\!
Punk.22=... but trust me. I'm doing this for us all.
Punk.23=What?\! Oh what, no uh... I...
Punk.24=Brozu... please.
Punk.25=I'm telling you I barely know the basics...
Punk.26=Y'are the ONLY guy 'ere who can do it, we need your help. For Cress... sis.
Punk.27=Cress really hurt herself out there didn't she...
Punk.28=That ugly monster-thing did it\!
Punk.29=Noises aren't monsters they're just... data.
Punk.3=No\! But you're talking to me\!
Punk.30=... I talked back at her and still she protected me. She's still recovering from that... she's a proper Punk.
Punk.31=... I know a place where we can train.
Punk.32=So what are we supposed to do?
Punk.33=Well Noises are just jammed together data. There used to be an ice-cream factory and a petting zoo here sooo...
Punk.34=There he is.
Punk.35=He?
Punk.36=Uh "it" we call them Alexsanders.
Punk.37=What do I do?
Punk.38=Observe its pattern, that is the first rule. Noises are programs, they don't adapt...
Punk.39=... they have one fixed moveset they always use. Observe and... STRIKE FIRST\!
Punk.4=Ey\! I was talking\!
Punk.40=You did it\! Of course there are advanced techniques and strategies for every single Noise out there...
Punk.41=... but now you understand the basics\!
Punk.42=Brozu, can you teach me too?
Punk.43=And me?
Punk.44=How about us??
Punk.45=Whoa, whoa\! Let the man enjoy his coffee first.
Punk.46=What's this about coffee?
Punk.47=CRESS-SIS?\!
Punk.48=Once you understand that, something like this shouldn't happen again.
Punk.49=Gang, let's talk.
Punk.5=No\! It was me that was talking\!
Punk.50=Is it about tha plan?
Punk.51=What plan?
Punk.52=There's a plan?
Punk.53=There's a plan.
Punk.54=Let's talk about the plan.
Punk.55=What is... a plan?
Punk.56=It is... when you do more than just punch a thing to solve your problems.
Punk.57=Shooting is also ok, you see?
Punk.58=... LISTEN\! We're going on a trip. Not all of you, just the strongest ones and Rozu.
Punk.59=Uhm...
Punk.6=I DON'T THINK SO BUDDY\!
Punk.60=You're our Noise expert dummy. We need you on this one.
Punk.61=Rozu, {0} and me. We'll go near Harosh not far from here. There have been way more Noise sightings than usual there...
Punk.62=... and I suspect D-... Azure Shield has something to do with it.
Punk.63=That posh tech-company?
Punk.64=Yeah. I've seen them work with Noises before and I don't like it.
Punk.65=Work WITH Noises? That... wait I've seen that before\!
Punk.66=A hot-... I mean a guy dressed for HOT climate was running around the Glacial Pathways with 2 Greeds\!
Punk.67=Doesn't bode well does it? The other team will go to Arahas Desert.
Punk.68=A what?
Punk.69=Trust me it's better not to know right now.  
Punk.7=BUDDY? BUDDY???
Punk.70=Enter the site, don't get too close to the giant monster-looking thing...
Punk.71=UNDERSTOOD\!
Punk.72=THEN LET'S GO\!
Punk.73=Cress why didn't you go with the other team? This seems like a really chill... hike?
Punk.74=I want Azure Shield to concentrate their attention and security on their desert project for now.
Punk.75=There is no way we can stop what they're doing... not when they have some means of producing Noises.
Punk.76=THAT'S what they're doing?
Punk.77=It's what I suspect. And I suspect it a lot. So we need to stop that.
Punk.78=Cress-sis. Something is following us. Don't like it. Is it a good plan to, uh, punch it...?
Punk.79=That is a very good plan, yes.
Punk.8=You uh, wanna grab some grub?
Punk.80=Thank\! You\!
Punk.81=Do you think they've noticed us?
Punk.82=No way. Look at those meatbags, they don't notice anything.
Punk.83=FELLAS, I've got a plan\!
Punk.84=Plans are fun\!
Punk.85=Hey, what did I miss?
Punk.86=They... they built a Noise factory\!
Punk.87=This will require one hell of a plan...
Punk.88=... and leave immediately. Make it look like you're just doing... punk stuff.
Punk.89=Azure Shield is working on something there. All I want you to do is create some ruckus there.
Punk.9=Absolutely\!
Punk.90=Ya heard Cress\! Let's crush this thing from multiple sites\!
Punk.91=What if we get caught?
Punk.92=Well Puppy what do ya usually do when someone does something you don't like?
Punk.93=Shoot VOCs with my knuckles?
Punk.94=And what are ya gonna do when somebody is trying to catch ya?
Punk.95=Oh\! I get it now\! Thanks big sis\!
Punk.96=Spread out and meet up back 'ere in 2 hours\!
Punk.97=Aye\!
Punk.98=Brozu prepared me for this\!
Punk.99=Oh. Okay. For Cress-sis\!

Rozu.4=Watch out\!
Rozu.4.1=Hey\! Why aren't they attacking you?\!
Rozu.4.2=Let's say... we trained them.
Rozu.4.3=You shouldn't be doing this.
Rozu.4.4=It's all good man. We do what we do\nfor the greater good. You're a Noise\nHunter aren't you?
Rozu.4.5=Don't you want Noises and\nhumans to live in harmony?
Rozu.4.6=This cannot bring any good\!\nWe... we guard the roads\!
Rozu.5=Phew that was close.\nSofas just looove sinking their teeth\ninto human butts I tell ya\!
