Agent.1.11=Congratulations\!
Agent.1.12=Congratulations\!
Agent.1.13=Thank you\! I hope\nI can be of service\!
Agent.1.14=Of course. You will\nstart immediately\!
Agent.1.2=Standard procedure with this one?
Agent.1.3=Looks like it.
Agent.1.4=H-hi\!
Agent.1.5=Hello. Let's get right to it.
Agent.1.6=Before you can join us, you\nneed to prove your skills.
Agent.1.7=But first, tell us why you\nwant to be one of us.
Agent.1.8=My... our world is suffering\! There just\naren't enough resources... if Azure Shield\nsucceeds we can help everyone\!
Agent.1.9=We can provide infinite food\nand water to everyone\!
Agent.2.1=So... why are we here?
Agent.2.10=Aren't we just the best couple\nAzure Shield has ever seen?
Agent.2.11=*They laugh together*
Agent.2.2=Did you not listen to\nthe general again?\nYou're the worst\!
Agent.2.3=C'mon just tell me. Without\nme you won't be able to\nfinish this job either.
Agent.2.4=It's a simple scouting mission.\nIt's best if you don't get involved,\nso just stay behind...
Agent.2.5=No reason to be rude.
Agent.2.6=Shoot\! I knew we should've disguised ourselves\!
Agent.2.7=Jess are you ok?\nYou look hurt.
Agent.2.8=Ouch\! It's... we started\nbickering again, instead\nof preparing for the job.
Agent.2.9=... Classic Jess and Sarah eh?
Agent.3.1=I'm already late. If I don't hurry they- oh no.
Agent.3.10=Wait\!
Agent.3.11=Oh no... What do I tell Cress?
Agent.3.2=Ha HA\! I reached it first\!
Agent.3.3=Noo... wait. Doesn't Crimson Force\nhave different outfits?
Agent.3.4=A Noise Hunter always stays in his uniform.
Agent.3.5=Whatever that means... Anyways, you need\nto step away from that thing buddy, because\nI really need to blow it up.
Agent.3.6=I will stop you\! In the\nname of Crimson Justice\!
Agent.3.7=Yes\! I did it\!
Agent.3.8=You still haven't defeated me\!
Agent.3.9=Well that was never part of my\nmission\! I'm done here, see ya\!
Agent.4.1=Fin? What a coincidence\!
Agent.4.10=She's running late again so... sure\!
Agent.4.11=Was nice hanging out with you pal\!\nGotta hurry now\!
Agent.4.12=See ya\!
Agent.4.13=Did you just defeat an Azure Shield member?\nThat's really cool man.
Agent.4.14=Oh... yup\! I totally did\!
Agent.4.15=Then I guess I won't have\nto hold back anymore\! Hehe.
Agent.4.16=Yeah.
Agent.4.17=(Uh-oh)
Agent.4.2=Charles? Wow I didn't\nrecognize you in that...\noutfit.
Agent.4.3=Oh, do you like it? I'm actually\non my work to a mission right now.
Agent.4.4=Isn't Azure Shield kinda... weird?
Agent.4.5=Uh, I don't think so. They pay\nwell and I feel like I'm doing\nsomething good for the world\!
Agent.4.6=I don't know about that...
Agent.4.7=... Hey listen. I can see that you don't\nwant to talk about this stuff, so...\nWhat are you up to?
Agent.4.8=Waiting for my date.\nWe're gonna train a bit.
Agent.4.9=Like with VOCs? Hey do you want to\nlearn some tricks I picked up at work?\nI bet you could impress them with those.
Agent.5.1=Agent, how many troops\ndo we have left?
Agent.5.10=Well WE made it in time.
Agent.5.11=Were you behind all this?
Agent.5.2=They're all severly wounded,\nI'm the only one left\!
Agent.5.3=Crimson Force has blocked the teleportation\npathways, so until reinforcements arrive it\nis up to you to stop the Noise outbreak.
Agent.5.4=You need to enter the factory and reach the\ncentral Voxel Generator. Destroy itimmediately\nso that no new Noises will be able to spawn. Good luck.
Agent.5.5=I did it\! But there are still Noises\nspilling out into the streets...
Agent.5.6=The heroes have come to save the day\!
Agent.5.7=Huh?
Agent.5.8=It's Cress\!
Agent.5.9="Heroes"? Because of you, our\ntroops couldn't make it in time.
Agent.6.1=There is no need for violence now.
Agent.6.10=... What?
Agent.6.11=Agent\! We need you outside immediately\!
Agent.6.12=What is going on???
Agent.6.13=The real battle is about to begin.
Agent.6.2=M-ms. Del\!
Agent.6.3=You are Delicia right?\nCress told me about you.
Agent.6.4=...
Agent.6.5=Why are you doing this? Doesn't Crimson\nForce want the same thing as us?
Agent.6.6=Look buddy, you're clearly in the wrong here.\nThis is no ordinary factory and you know it.
Agent.6.7=... Agent, I shall leave this one to you.\nSomething's not right here.
Agent.6.8=Let's rock n' roll\!
Agent.6.9=Oh... welp, I was just supposed to\ndistract you. See ya\!
