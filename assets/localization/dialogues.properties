A.Agent.Sus.1=Well you’re obviously a spy.

A.Agent.Yven.Banter.1.2=Giant Crystal Arm?
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.1.3=Riiiight.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.2.1=There is a rumor that you were the first Azure Agent, is that true sir?
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.2.2=No comment.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.3.1=What's your secret sir?
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.3.2=My secret to what?
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.3.3=Your success.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.3.4=What success? Is the mission finished?
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.3.5=No I was just... nevermind.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.4.1=The mission is going well sir\!
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.4.2=I would hope so... but I just can’t help but get involved myself.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.4.3=Oh... I wasn't... I didn't mean to offend\!
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.4.4=... At ease agent.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.5.1=Sir, I've always wondered... is your arm a VOC?
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.5.2=Which arm?
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.5.3=The giant crystal one.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.5.4=Oh, that one isn't a VOC no.
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.6.1=HEY\! No slacking off\!
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.6.2=SORRY SIR\! MS. DEL SAID I COULD HAVE THE DAY OFF\!
A.Agent.Yven.Banter.6.3=And where is your proof of that?

A.Event.Agent.Gift.5=Perfect. As you were agent.
A.Event.Agent.Gift.6=Ma'am\!
A.Event.Agent.Trap.1.1=Ohoho I didn't think the GREAT Cress would fall into my trap\!
A.Event.Agent.Trap.1.2=Hey hold on a minute. I don't fall. I ran here.
A.Event.Agent.Trap.1.22=Like I said\: I don't fall. I run all over you\!
A.Event.Agent.Trap.1.3=Whatever, let's go girls\!
A.Event.Agent.Trap.2.1.1=She REALLY fell for it ohmygoshh
A.Event.Agent.Trap.2.1.2=Uh m'am? For an archeologist you seem pretty dumb.
A.Event.Agent.Trap.2.1.3=How am I the dumb one when you've decided to stand in my way?
A.Event.Bella=Hi\! I don't know who you are or even where we are but I can see you're doing your best out here\! I'll leave you a little gift to ease your struggle a bit. See ya\!
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.1=Found you\!
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.3=You've been skipping on our training session\!
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.4=...no I haven't. Today is artifact day, remember?
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.5=Don't give me excuses\! Let me hear your battlecry\!
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.Win.1=You beat me... I've been a good teacher... now I can die in peace.
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.Win.2=DIE?
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.Win.5=I was just joking you know.
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.Win.7=You old worrywart. 
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.Win.8=*Spark proceeds to do a perfect backflip and then runs off.*
A.Event.Fin.VS.Spark.Win.9=I'm so embarrased.
A.Event.Flink.Gift.1=Cress-sis\!
A.Event.Flink.Gift.2=Flink\!
A.Event.Flink.Gift.3=CRESS-SIS
A.Event.Flink.Gift.4=FLINK

A.Event.Flink.Gift.6=BECAUSE OF ALL THESE NOISES SURROUNDING US
A.Event.Flink.Gift.7=Heh, nice one. Look I can turn into a lootbox.
A.Event.Noise.Gift.1.1=\:3
A.Event.Noise.Gift.1.2=Oh, hello there little fella. Why aren't you attacking me?
A.Event.Noise.Gift.1.3=*meow*
A.Event.Noise.Gift.1.4=...wait. I remember you. You're one of the first Noises I caught\! \nHow... are you?
A.Event.Noise.Gift.1.5=CAT NOISE
A.Event.Noise.Gift.1.6=Did you just say "Cat Noise"? I need to write this down this is incredible - wait don't go\!
A.Event.Noise.Gift.2=Aw.
A.Event.Punk.Trap.1.1=Punks.
A.Event.Punk.Trap.1.12=Run back to your base and remember who gave you these bruises.
A.Event.Punk.Trap.1.2=Delicia.
A.Event.Punk.Trap.1.3=Ah I remember you. You're Cress' favorite right?
A.Event.Punk.Trap.1.4=... how would you know that.
A.Event.Punk.Trap.1.5=Cress has favorites?
A.Event.Punk.Trap.1.6=Until she forgets them. Let's see if she'll remember you after I'm done here.
A.Event.Punk.Trap.2.1=I told you she'd come here\!
A.Event.Punk.Trap.2.2=You didn't\! We got lost and now the leader of Azure Shield is going to kill us.
A.Event.Punk.Trap.2.3=Why does everyone think of me as a killer?
A.Event.Punk.Trap.2.4=You won't hurt us?
A.Event.Punk.Trap.2.5=Well.. are you standing in my way?
A.Event.Punk.Trap.2.6=One hundred percent\! Let's go\!
A.Event.Rozu.Gift.2='sup I'm in a hurry here
A.Event.Rozu.Gift.3=That's why I brought you some nice caffeine\!
A.Event.Rozu.Gift.4=You are a literal life saver Brozu. I'd kill for some coffee right now.
A.Event.Rozu.Gift.5=Coffee... right. I'll just... leave this here and we'll see each other back at HQ. Later\!
A.Event.SaffronGift.1.Text=You’re almost at your goal\!\r
A.Event.SaffronGift.2.Text=I was actually trying to find the artefacts myself…
A.Event.SaffronGift.3.Text=But I don’t think they have any connection to the Calamity Spell.\r
A.Event.SaffronGift.4.Text=I have more VOCs with me than I can use so take one\!
A.Event.Spark.Gift.1.1=Yo\!
A.Event.Spark.Gift.1.2=Spark I'm in a hurry\!
A.Event.Spark.Gift.1.3=Well so am I\! Just thought I'd bring you a little support.
A.Event.Spark.Gift.1.4=...you mean coffee? You brought me coffee?
A.Event.Spark.Gift.1.5=Definitely. See ya later. Oh and remember my gift next time we duel\!
A.Event.Spark.Gift.2.1.2=Hey Brozu whatcha doing?
A.Event.Spark.Gift.2.1.3=...My job? Our job?
A.Event.Spark.Gift.2.1.4=Oh, cool cool... keep doing that. I'll see you at the finish line.
A.Event.Spark.Gift.2.1.5=This isn't a race...
A.Event.Spark.Gift.2.1.6=Not with that attitude it's not\! See ya chump\!
A.Event.Spark.Gift.2.2=That girl is driving me crazy. Whoa she dropped something... on purpose?
A.Log.1.1=Log \#1\: Ok I’m gonna record everything I know here just in case anybody would be CRAZY enough to re-activate this thing.
A.Log.1.2=Here are 700 reasons why YOU shouldn’t reawaken the Godius known as “EX-erian”...
A.Log.10.1=Log\: \#10\: Yes, it does contain the means to create infinite resources.
A.Log.10.2=But like I said\: The cost is EVERYTHING.
A.Log.111.1=Log \#111\: Oh I forgot to mention that it can read your mind and use your weaknesses against you.
A.Log.111.2=Wasn’t easy to implement that feature but here we are.
A.Log.14.1=Log \#14\: It’ll enter your dreams. How? I’d rather not say. But it’ll wait for you there.
A.Log.14.2=If you don’t meet it tonight, it just means it’s hiding in a corner of your mind you can’t see.
A.Log.274.1=Log \#274\: It hates trees\! What? Yeah\!
A.Log.274.2=Why? Because trees are good\! And this machi- this creature kills anything that is good in this world\!
A.Log.28.1=Log\: \#28\: It never stops. It’s not designed to. The prototype “Exerian” is supposed to decompose...
A.Log.28.2=... but my contractors told me to remove that feature. Not sure why they thought that was a good idea...
A.Log.327.1=Log\: \#327\: I did NOT give it that color. I do not know HOW it turned that shade...
A.Log.327.2=... but judging from how fresh the paint always looks, I’m thinking it regularly kills something to soak itself in- well you get the point.
A.Log.350.1=Log \#350\: Whew\! Already halfway through\! Ok here goes the next one\: You will grow to love it. Seriously.
A.Log.350.2=And then all the 700 reasons I’ve named won’t be able to sway you\! Even if it kills everyone else in your life. The people here can tell you that first hand.
A.Log.5=Log\: \#5\: If you think you have found a way to control it\: YOU. CAN’T.
A.Log.504.1=Log \#504\: It’s really annoying to keep clean. I haven’t been able to invent all the tools necessary to reach the deepest corners of this thing...
A.Log.504.2=... And you don’t want to know what gets stuck in there. Or who.
A.Log.580.1=Log \#580\: Is it my fault? Maybe, who knows. I just gave them what they wanted.
A.Log.580.2=And it wouldn’t have been fair to only give ONE nation one of these. I can’t be responsible for how they use it, can I?
A.Log.600.1=Log \#600\: It has no face.
A.Log.600.2=But Y\#1\!Lq$qT5 I can clearly see that it has one.
A.Log.600.3=That’s the messed up thing\! It DOESN'T... I can see it too but I swear to you. I did not put a face there and it- well trust me it’s just not there\!
A.Log.7.1=Log \#7\: This continent used to be a whole lot bigger before this monstrosity got activated.
A.Log.7.2=But I guess you could say that for all the Godi...
A.Log.80.1=Log\: \#80\: A lot of people have met Exerian and soon after forgotten all about it.
A.Log.80.2=Yes that’s intentional, and YES that made it a nightmare to design.
A.Log.94.1=Log\: \#94\: It once disappeared for a whole month. I didn’t find it... as much as it just popped back into existence in front of my house.
A.Log.94.2=Actually I'm not sure if that really happened … Wait, that’s another reason\!
A.Punk.Punk.Betray.3.1=Whoa, easy there good bro fella sir.
A.Punk.Rozu.Talk.7.4=*Cause I haven't told you hehe... Yeesh, I really wish I knew what Noises are though*
A.Punk.Sus.1=You can’t just waltz in here\!
A.Punk.Sus.2=Your hair ain’t punk-y at all\!
A.Punk.Sus.3=Not sure who you are, but just to be safe...
A.Punk.Sus.4=Let us show you what a "Plan" is\!
A.StartSaffron.1.Text=Time for some adventure. In the name of science and frienship\!
A.StartSaffron.2.Text=Del is so nice for letting me hang out with Azure Shield\!
A.StartSaffron.3.Text=And with this map she gave me I'll be sure to find all the Calamity Spells in no time\!\!
Adventure.Azure.Betray.1=There is so much we could learn from the punks\!
Adventure.Azure.Betray.2=Azure Shield is making a mistake\! I want to join Cress.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.3=How can we build a future without learning from the past?
Adventure.Azure.Betray.4=Ouch haha\! Nice hit.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.5=Out of my way.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.6=What... exactly... are you doing? We're a canon remember?
Adventure.Azure.Betray.7=I'm breaking out of the symphony.
Adventure.Azure.Betray.8=I'm done with music. From now on I want to punch my enemies.
Adventure.Azure.Del.1=Agents.
Adventure.Azure.Del.10=Thank you Agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.11=Why are the Punks fighting against us?
Adventure.Azure.Del.12=They have an extremely charismatic leader.
Adventure.Azure.Del.13=And why is she fighting against us?
Adventure.Azure.Del.14=That shouldn't be our concern.
Adventure.Azure.Del.15=Ma'am, w-would you sign this birthday card for Charlie?
Adventure.Azure.Del.16=You brought a birthday card to a mission? What is your name agent?
Adventure.Azure.Del.17=... It's Charlie.
Adventure.Azure.Del.18=Oh... you can have the day off. Happy birthday Agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.19=Thank you so much ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.2=This quadrant is clear ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.20=Ma'am I just wanted to tell you that it is an honor to serve you\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.21=*... I wonder if Cress' Punks talk to her like this.*
Adventure.Azure.Del.22=Routine performance check. I'm sure you don't mind.
Adventure.Azure.Del.23=Of course not.
Adventure.Azure.Del.24=Agents, assist me by serving as sparring partners.
Adventure.Azure.Del.25=YES Ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.26=With all due respect - that hurt.
Adventure.Azure.Del.27=It is an honor to serve under you\! Allow us to present to you our combat capabilities\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.28=We are always ready for combat\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.29=As you should be.
Adventure.Azure.Del.3=Ma'am I just wanted to tell you that I wish you a very nice day\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.30=Good work agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.31=Th-thank you\! Here is a token of my appreciation\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.32=You did amiably agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.33=Thanks chief. I promised my wife to give you this should I ever meet you.
Adventure.Azure.Del.34=Agent, do you by any chance carry extra supplies with you?
Adventure.Azure.Del.35=As per protocol\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.36=Excellent VOC-use Agent\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.37=Thank you ma'am, I took the liberty of preparing your afternoon tea at the same time... as well as this\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.38=Am- am I getting fired?
Adventure.Azure.Del.39=No. Promoted.
Adventure.Azure.Del.4=Agent Champino ready for duty\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.40=Oh wow\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.41=Fetch me a tea first though.
Adventure.Azure.Del.42=Of course\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.43=Now I've really done it...
Adventure.Azure.Del.44=Excellent Agent. We need more of your caliber at Azure Shield.
Adventure.Azure.Del.45=Not bad Agent. Not bad at all.
Adventure.Azure.Del.46=I- I won't tell anyone about this\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.47=Good idea.
Adventure.Azure.Del.48=Be not afraid.
Adventure.Azure.Del.49=Ma'am this is the scariest moment of my life
Adventure.Azure.Del.5=I shall have one after this mission is finished.
Adventure.Azure.Del.50=I can't believe this\! How did I do that?
Adventure.Azure.Del.51=By sheer skill Agent. Good work.
Adventure.Azure.Del.52=I thought you were unbeatable\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.53=We're all only human, Agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.54=It's Delicia - everybody keep doing a great job\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.55=Ma'am congratulations on your mission so far\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.56=Delicia is here\! Quick put a kettle on\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.57=Ma'am\! I'm off to my mission\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.58=Good luck Agent. And do not forget to use the Noise Capture VOC I uploaded to your Voxel Generator.
Adventure.Azure.Del.59=Thank you so much ma'am\!
Adventure.Azure.Del.6=Ma'am would you like something to drink?
Adventure.Azure.Del.7=Focus on the mission agent.
Adventure.Azure.Del.8=B-but my mission is to bring you drinks.
Adventure.Azure.Del.9=...I'll have an Earl Grey then.
Adventure.Azure.Double.1=Dude blue or red. There can't be an inbetween\!
Adventure.Azure.Double.2=Oh, it's the wild card\!
Adventure.Azure.Double.3=So you think you'll come far by yourself?
Adventure.Azure.Double.4=I mean at least you didn't become a Punk, I guess.
Adventure.Azure.Double.5=We really don't have time for a flip-flopper like you.
Adventure.Azure.Double.6=Somebody who is willing to go their own way\! I like you\!
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.1=So I know we're not supposed to like Noises...
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.10=Guess what chord I play after fighting a punk. The F chord\!
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.11=...Eat Apples Daily Grow Big Ears... Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie..
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.2=... but some of them are pretty cute don't you think?
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.3=That sofa's vibe is really getting to me.
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.4=Tea? Teeeaaa? Or coffeeeee???
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.5=Man I can't wait for payday...
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.6=What? I want to buy my cat its own keytar.
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.7=A B C D E F G\nCome and beat some punks with me\!
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.8=There's a calm before the storm-and that calm is me. The storm? Oh it's coming.
Adventure.Azure.Gossip.9=And I'm ready for it. Because I'm the calm.
Adventure.Azure.RPunk.1=Do you want to become an agent or... just lurk about?
Adventure.Azure.RPunk.2=Hey if you ain't a Punk no more... mind telling us how to get into their HQ?
Adventure.Azure.RPunk.3=A Punk who is willing to betray their own team? I've got a feeling our boss will like you.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.1=Imagine a band made up of Noises\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.10=Hey I'm new here... do you think it would be cool to take my pet to work?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.11=Depends on the pet I guess?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.12=It is azure colored\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.13=... That's not what I meant.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.14=Glockenspiel, allegro, pizzicato, ritardando...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.15=Uh, what are you doing?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.16=Learning as many music-y words as I can\! It is my duty as an agent\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.17=*Uh... wait... is it?\!*
Adventure.Azure.Talk.18=I LOVE your face.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.19=Oh my gosh, I love YOURS\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.2=Ok... imagining.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.20=What a coincidence\! Hahaha\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.21=So funny\! Hahaha\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.22=Little did they know that they were long lost twins.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.23=Hey, know any good barbers in town?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.24=No you?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.25=I wish.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.26=You trying to join a barbershop-
Adventure.Azure.Talk.27=-QUARTET exactly.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.28=Hey\! Hey get this\! Apparently Yven has a dark secret\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.29=Oh? Tell me\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.3=Just kidding. Every band is made up of Noise\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.30=Tell me\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.31=Wait, that's what I said.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.32=It's like that huh? Mysterious, that Yven.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.33=So I don't really agree with Cress' ideologies...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.34=But you love her style?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.35=Can't deny.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.36=I just don't GET how people can support Crimson Force\! They're LITERALLY evil\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.37=Yeah they're doing some messed up stuff.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.38=Right? And all we do is try to save the world\! If it weren't for them we could do it no problem.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.39=I can't say I fully understand our goals here but... I do enjoy the camaraderie.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.4=I can't believe Del and Yven both remembered my birthday\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.40=Agents always stick together\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.41=And always brew tea in case Del shows up\! Not that I'm complaining...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.42=You're allowed to complain you know. Del even encourages us to do so\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.43=No I really love tea\! Would love to brew it professionally someday...
Adventure.Azure.Talk.44=I used to be a programmer before all this.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.45=Oh? What made you join the Shield?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.46=I was always part of Azure Shield, but I wanted to stay as near to Del as I possibly could.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.47=A weird girl in a... jungle outfit? Came and beat me up real good yesterday.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.48=Do you think she was part of Crimson Force?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.49=I SWEAR I saw her punch a Punk right before that. Not sure if that is what a teammate would do.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.5=Is it really your birthday though?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.50=The Force sure has got some wild new recruits lately.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.51=They got a Noise Hunter... might become real troublesome if we're not careful.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.52=I will report that as soon as possible\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.53=Del fights gracefully and efficiently... while Cress is really good at kicking people.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.54=What are you trying to say?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.55=That I just don't get how people could follow such a brute\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.6=Don't ruin this for me\!
Adventure.Azure.Talk.7=Hey hypothetically... Do you think one can be an Agent without knowing anything about music?
Adventure.Azure.Talk.8=No... because everyone has a song in their heart.
Adventure.Azure.Talk.9=You are dumb as heck, man.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.1=Phew, that took a lot out of me.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.10=Good duel\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.11=Game set...\! The winner is... not my back\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.12=Aw man, my keytar got all out of tune from that...
Adventure.Azure.Tired.2=Our battle formation was in good tact for a while there\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.3=I really gotta upgrade my VOCs, these ain't groovin' at all.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.4=Good grief, I'm getting out of shape. Gotta exercise a little more...
Adventure.Azure.Tired.5=Whoa, the thrill of a Voxel Duel always gives me goosebumps.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.6=While battling you, I thought I saw the light at the end of the tunnel for a second there.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.7=Plan Delta-12 really didn't work as planned... I'll use Delta-13 next time\!
Adventure.Azure.Tired.8=Wow, it really was an honor fighting you.
Adventure.Azure.Tired.9=Man, now I got this song stuck in my head... dadada DA\! DA Da da, da dA DA\!
Adventure.Azure.Tower.1=Hello? I didn't sign up for this\!
Adventure.AzureAzure.1=Fellow Agent reporting in\! How is your status?
Adventure.AzureAzure.2=Hello Agent\! How has your mission so far been?
Adventure.AzureAzure.3=Oh, making a pit stop? Let my squad know if we can help out anyhow.
Adventure.AzureJoin.1=Hello again\! We are Azure Shield, the agents that will free this world from all suffering.
Adventure.AzureJoin.2=Would you like to join our cause? We can issue you a temporary membership immediately\! The test can wait for later\!
Adventure.AzureJoin.3=I believe you might not understand what is at stake here.
Adventure.AzureJoin.4=... our world, Anikka, could suffer tremendously. Please reconsider...
Adventure.AzureJoin.5=Perfect\! Welcome aboard, let's get you outfitted...
Adventure.AzureJoin.6=Looking more like a proper Agent already\! Now remember...
Adventure.AzureJoin.7=We will transform this world. Crimson wants to stop us, but you must fight for what is truly right.
Adventure.AzureJoin.8=Good luck out there Azure Agent\!
Adventure.AzureJoin.Bella.1=Sorry, but I'm already a Lunex warrior\!
Adventure.AzureJoin.Bella.2=A wha-....? Well, too bad.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Bella.3=*What a whacko.*
Adventure.AzureJoin.Fin=I-... I'm not so sure that is a good idea...
Adventure.AzureJoin.Fin.2=(This guy is a total pushover... But it doesn't seem like he will be joining us anytime soon.)
Adventure.AzureJoin.Jeremy=Nah man, that would suck. I prefer riding solo.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Jeremy.2=Urg- fine. Feel free to change your mind.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Message=Join Azure Shield?
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.1=You don't know what's good for ya. Lotsa dark clouds in the sky.
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.2=*Hours of piano lessons later*
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.3=Hey\! You turned against the Punks right?
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.4=Yeah, so?
Adventure.AzureJoin.Rpunk.5=How about hanging with us instead?
Adventure.AzureNoise.1=A noise\!\! Let's capture it and analyze its data\!
Adventure.AzureNoise.2=We found a noise\! This one could be valuable for her research...\!
Adventure.AzureNoise.3=Hey\! Finally we can test out our new toys\! Time to catch it\!
Adventure.AzureOther.1=Oh hello... are you a new recruit? Let's get you enlisted shall we?
Adventure.AzureOther.10=Sorry, can't talk we have to focus on our mission.
Adventure.AzureOther.2=A new member? We welcome you to join our ranks\! Together, we can end this world's suffering\!
Adventure.AzureOther.3=Oh... you're an Agent? Did you forget your uniform?\nWhy would you do that?
Adventure.AzureOther.4=New recruit? Don't forget your threads ever again.
Adventure.AzureOther.5=Hi, apologies but we cannot speak with non-agents during missions.
Adventure.AzureOther.6=I'd love to talk, I am however on duty.
Adventure.AzureOther.7=You need to become an agent to be allowed to talk to me\!
Adventure.AzureOther.8=Hello, please do not disturb us mid-mission.
Adventure.AzureOther.9=Talking with non-Agents during missions is forbidden.
Adventure.AzurePunk.1=Get into battle formation\! We are being attacked by Crimson\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.10=Get your instrumental Voxel Generators ready squad.... Attack\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.11=We would rather not do this, but you punks leave us no choice... prepare for combat\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.2=It's Crimson\!\! Everyone, remember Plan Delta-12\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.3=Well, well, well\! If it isn't one of the brutes.
Adventure.AzurePunk.4=Hope you're ready to face our advanced strategies\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.5=Oh hey, it's a meathead\! You guys want to show them what us Agents are made of?
Adventure.AzurePunk.6=Hah, look at that Crimson thinking they can take us all on at once.
Adventure.AzurePunk.7=Let's test out the tech Del bestowed us with on them\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.8=It's one of the punks\! Time for a little demonstration of power\!
Adventure.AzurePunk.9=Hey\! Is this meathead looking for a fight?
Adventure.AzureSupply.1=Here\! This is the newest tech issued to us by Del\!
Adventure.AzureSupply.2=Did you get this yet? It's being distributed by the HQ.
Adventure.AzureSupply.3=A little gift to a fellow Agent\! We got our hands on it by beating some nosy punks\!
Adventure.AzureSupply.4=Hey, have you gotten this yet? R&D has been working on it for a while now.
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.1=Use it wisely.
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.2=We should only use this to fulfill our end-goals. Don't get distracted\!
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.3=Do not overdo it okay? We can't afford losing anyone after all.
Adventure.AzureSupply.After.4=Glory to Azure Shield\! Let's work together for a better world.
Adventure.AzureSupply.Del.1=Ma'am\! We secured the item\! The mission was a great success\!
Adventure.AzureSupply.Del.2=Good job Agent.
Adventure.AzureSupply.Del.3=Thank you ma'am\!

Adventure.Bella.Beach.1=AHHHHHH\! A beach?\! Wowowow I always dreamed of seeing one some day\! It's so nice here\!
Adventure.Bella.Cavern.1=All this ice is making me crave some Ice Cream...
Adventure.Bella.Clocks.1=This Clockwork Factory is massive\! There's so many materials here that can be repurposed...
Adventure.Bella.Clocks.2=Ah, I don't have much *time* (heh puns), I've gotta keep moving forward\!
Adventure.Bella.Desert.1=This desert... reminds me of the Lunar suface outside the colonies. Let's go\! There's discoveries to be made\!
Adventure.Bella.Forest.1=Wow\! This place is beautiful\! All this nature... Could this be what it was like back on Terra? 
Adventure.Bella.Fragment.1=Sweet\! This is a... data fragment\!? Let's try to complete it, heh\! Let's zip\!
Adventure.Bella.Galaxy.1=Are we in space? This area... is very strange.
Adventure.Bella.Galaxy.2=It kinda reminds me of the Phantom Realm... Oh well, no use sitting around. I've got to press forward\!
Adventure.Bella.Glacial.1=Brrr, this place is as cold as Luna\! I should've worn my Snow Suit\!
Adventure.Bella.Midius.1=Oh no... This place must be the site of countless battles... I hope the citizens were okay.
Adventure.Bella.Midius.2=I hope there's no Murks around here\!
Adventure.Bella.Networld.1=Wha- what is this?\! Was... my body turned into data? ...FASCINATING\! Let's see where this leads\!\!
Adventure.Bella.Punk.1=Sorry sorry\! I can see you're nice people, but I'm on a mission\!
Adventure.Bella.Punk.2=Ah, no worries\! Good luck then.
Adventure.Bella.Punk.3=Thank you\!
Adventure.Bella.Ruins.1=Ruins? Nickle would love it here. I bet there's some secrets or treasures laying around\!\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.1=Hey bro, can you come over?
Adventure.Call.Punk.10=Listen, let me explain. I have my reasons.
Adventure.Call.Punk.11=Sorry... I know we used to be friends, but what you did is irreversible. Goodbye.
Adventure.Call.Punk.12=Hey I need backup\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.13=On my way\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.14=I can't finish this mission on my own\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.15=I'll help you out\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.16=Thanks for-
Adventure.Call.Punk.17=LET'S GO\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.18=Hey so what's the-
Adventure.Call.Punk.19=Follow me. Don't talk too much.
Adventure.Call.Punk.2=Ya sure bro.
Adventure.Call.Punk.20=Got any Punks to spare?
Adventure.Call.Punk.21=Yeah, me\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.22=Yo this mission is getting boring on my own, wanna co-op?
Adventure.Call.Punk.23=Always do if it's with you\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.24=Code Red\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.25=Send one over\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.26=I'll need one of you to come here.
Adventure.Call.Punk.27=That's chill.
Adventure.Call.Punk.28=Okey dokey sis\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.29=Already rushing over to you\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.3=Sup? Let's go\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.4=Uhhh I'd love to, but I'm hella busy. Another time\!
Adventure.Call.Punk.5=Sorry bro, I got this poker game going on and I need to win back my pants first.
Adventure.Call.Punk.6=Ey bro, remember that one time I lent you my toothbrush?
Adventure.Call.Punk.7=Wha- oh uh right not isn't good, sorry\! I'll pay you back later ok?
Adventure.Call.Punk.8=Say no more.
Adventure.Call.Punk.9=Well, well, well if it ain't the traitor.
Adventure.Cress.Arahas.1=There's an abnormally big amount of Agent activity in this area. I wouldn't be surprised if their base was nearby.
Adventure.Cress.Midius.1=Del... I can't undo the past, but I will stop you from repeating it.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.1=Huh? What's wrong with you?
Adventure.Cress.Punk.10=What? No I didn't.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.11=You're such a good leader. I kinda feel sorry for betraying you.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.12=Get outta here\!
Adventure.Cress.Punk.2=I've had it with Crimson Force\! You don't see how necessary it is to take radical action, right NOW.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.3=Noo\! Cress-sis you accidentally thought that you're supposed to lose this fight\!
Adventure.Cress.Punk.4=Hey, good luck on your mission. Don't forget you can give us a call if you need help.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.5=Who is it NOW? ........Oh\! ...Hey.... Cress-sis.... how's it.... going...?
Adventure.Cress.Punk.6=We've just put on a fresh pot for you sister\!
Adventure.Cress.Punk.7=Everything in order sister\! Welcome to our post\!
Adventure.Cress.Punk.8=Thank you Cress-sis\! I'll make sure I'm successful.
Adventure.Cress.Punk.9=Well an enemy of the Force... is an enemy of mine\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.1=I've always wanted to do this\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.10=Got time for a little fight-to-go?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.11=No, not really and you don't either.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.12=Oh come on, it won't take long.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.13=I'll say.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.14=Time for a little match between the number one and the number two of Crimson Force\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.15=Do you really think you're our number two?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.16=Haha no. You are.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.17=You know - coffee is a plant.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.18=OK? ...So?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.19=Coffee is a plant just saying.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.2=Lose miserably against your own boss?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.20=But... we're on a mission.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.21=Yeah and you like coffee. I'm just sharing information. No need to make a big deal out of it.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.22=...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.23=Well...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.24=Well...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.25=See ya later.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.26=Now move aside.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.27=Geez don't be so mean about it.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.28=Fine fine sorry\! See you around the base.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.29=Wait- whuh?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.3=Oh very funny. Let's see what you've got\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.30=...
Adventure.Cress.Spark.31=I-I SEE YOU HAVEN'T HAD YOUR COFFEE YET\! LET ME GRAB YOU ONE\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.4=Spark, how good to see you.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.5=Why are you talking like that?
Adventure.Cress.Spark.6=It is a most fine morning for another exquisite kerfuffle with you my dear.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.7=Stop that\! Don't talk to me like that\!
Adventure.Cress.Spark.8=Posh posh posh.
Adventure.Cress.Spark.9=AAAAAYYYYEEEEEE\!\!\!
Adventure.Cress.Tower.1=Oh no. Not this.
Adventure.Crimson.Join.1=Become a punk in Crimson Force?
Adventure.Del.Midius.1=Being here... always makes me feel uncomfortable. Let's get this mission over with quickly.
Adventure.Del.Punk.1=Th-that's the Azure chief herself?\! Everyone, get ready\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.2=AGH\!? Prepare for an all-out attack by the Azure leader\!\!\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.3=D-DELICIA?\! What is she doing here?\! Prepare to defend\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.4=S-She found us\! L-Let's show her our Punk spirit everyone\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.5=Yikes Wazowski\!\!\! If we beat you, Cress will reward us\! Let's GOOO\!\!
Adventure.Del.Punk.6=Uh... uh-oh.
Adventure.Del.Punk.7=Oh... well squad... F.
Adventure.Del.Punk.8=RIP everyone.
Adventure.Del.Punk.9=Never give up punks\! Never let each other down\! Time to show her the punk way\!\!
Adventure.Del.Tower.1=... This is surprising. These stairs... get a move on, Del.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.1=An opening\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.10=I can sense when an agent leaves because they couldn't handle the truth.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.11=No, I... it's not like that\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.12=See if you can handle me then.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.13=Tell me Del - how does it feel knowing the ground beneath you is never safe?
Adventure.Del.Traitor.14=It feels good knowing that I have a team attempting to fix that.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.15=Well the feeling sickens me. YOU sicken me\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.16=You're just a civilian now, so there's no need to push this fight any further.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.17=...
Adventure.Del.Traitor.18=Remember where you stand. Because I will.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.19=Moving on.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.2=Oh no you don't...\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.20=Noo, you can't just leave me here.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.21=Don't worry. I'll send some agents to pick you up.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.22=Oh no.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.23=You don't have to be against us to not be with us you know.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.24=That will never be an option for me\! I see you for what you are\!\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.25=I can understand why you think that you're doing the right thing.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.26=But at this stage it is too late to stop us.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.3=... DARN... Compose yourself Delicia... they will get what's coming soon enough.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.4=So you're not happy with our policies I suppose?
Adventure.Del.Traitor.5=Azure Shield has got it all backwards\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.6=Then I recommend turning around.
Adventure.Del.Traitor.7=De-Delicia\!
Adventure.Del.Traitor.8=...
Adventure.Del.Traitor.9=I'll go through you\!
Adventure.Double.Tower.1=BRING IT ON\! WHATEVER THIS PLACE IS\! I CAN DO IIIIIIT.
Adventure.Double.Tower.2=Minor set-back not gonna lie. This isn't where I was headed at all.
Adventure.Double.Tower.3=But I can do it. On my own\!
Adventure.End.Agent.1=Finished\! Now let's get to all the paperwork this little mission requires.
Adventure.End.Agent.2=What was that? I think I need to lie down... Delicia has some explaining to do...
Adventure.End.Agent.3=Wait what? I didn't sign up for this. Where has that artifact brought me?
Adventure.End.Agent.4=Is this a normal day in the life of an agent? Ew I'm sweaty... I should go on vacation.
Adventure.End.Agent.5=Lona Vasse is supposed to be nice. I'll ask HQ if I can have the rest of the week off.
Adventure.End.Agent.6=Nothing interesting to report about this mission I suppose.
Adventure.End.Bella.1=Hey this thing seems powerful. Maybe this'll get me back home\!
Adventure.End.Bella.2=That was traumatizing. But. I... I did it\!\!\! Heck yeah\!
Adventure.End.Bella.3=Next stop\: home\! I'm in desparate need of some rest right about now\!
Adventure.End.Cress.1=... I hope nobody noticed I kept improvising throughout the whole thing... eh whatever.
Adventure.End.Cress.10=Are we too late? I don't think I can run any faster... I have to keep trying...
Adventure.End.Cress.2=The mission is finished, that's all that counts...
Adventure.End.Cress.3=I wonder how long we can keep stalling Azure Shield...
Adventure.End.Cress.4=Someday they'll get close enough to leave me no choice...
Adventure.End.Cress.5=For a project I basically whipped up myself this Crimson Force thing sure is going smoothly...
Adventure.End.Cress.6=... Thank my lucky stars I guess.
Adventure.End.Cress.7=Is it safe to take off the mask yet? I wonder what the people see in it?
Adventure.End.Cress.8=Does this piece of cloth really motivate people to stand up against the Shield?
Adventure.End.Cress.9=Or is it just... me?
Adventure.End.Del.1=Keep going... one step closer to saving humanity...
Adventure.End.Del.10=... and hope that nobody else finds these things before we can.
Adventure.End.Del.2=... And then we'll have tea in peace again.
Adventure.End.Del.3=The pressure Crimson Force is putting us under...
Adventure.End.Del.4=... it leaves us no choice but to move to the next step of our plan.
Adventure.End.Del.5=Time to go home... actually it would be better to just head back to base.
Adventure.End.Del.6=There is still so much work to do. Will it ever pay off?
Adventure.End.Del.7=... Only if you keep going Del. Only if you keep going.
Adventure.End.Del.8=See? You are strong enough to do this... but does this mean they're moving already?
Adventure.End.Del.9=I need to inspect these artifacts further...
Adventure.End.Double.1=No team, no backup, no fancy Noise technology. I did it ALL by myself. On MY terms\!
Adventure.End.Double.10=BRING IT ON\! NO CHALLENGE IS BIG ENOUGH FOR THE ME\!
Adventure.End.Double.2=I started out as an Agent, became a Punk. And now I'm just a Rogue.
Adventure.End.Double.3=BUT WORLD LOOK AT ME. I CAN DO IT ALL AND ALL BY MYSELF.
Adventure.End.Double.4=Why do I keep running from my relationships?
Adventure.End.Double.5=Is it really strength that I show when I refuse to help the world in either red or blue...
Adventure.End.Double.6=Wait wait wait... where am I? This is a set-back... I think.
Adventure.End.Double.7=I don't think this is where I was headed at all.
Adventure.End.Double.8=This thing. It cares not for parties. It happens no matter who is willing to take it on.
Adventure.End.Double.9=Cress or Del. One of them will... wait huh?
Adventure.End.Fin.1=Finished\! Oh I hope I'm not late for my date with Spark.
Adventure.End.Fin.10=I... I did it. What was that? How did it know my name? Wait did it talk? I need to write this down...
Adventure.End.Fin.11=Huh? Where am I? Oof I'm exhausted. Why do I feel like I just had a terrible fight...
Adventure.End.Fin.12=Oh no I need to clean up before I go back to the Crimson Force base\!
Adventure.End.Fin.2=I learned a bunch just from one mission... gosh I just love learning stuff.
Adventure.End.Fin.3=I should stick around those Punks more often.
Adventure.End.Fin.4=Am I a Punk because I help them out from time to time?
Adventure.End.Fin.5=Are Punks valuable members of society and upstanding citizens?
Adventure.End.Fin.6=I'll need to check at the Everod Library\!
Adventure.End.Fin.7=Who'd have thought I could get so much use of my good ol' drill. Well I did of course.
Adventure.End.Fin.8=I'd never go into a fight unprepared after all\!
Adventure.End.Fin.9=... Oh I should probably read up on some basic improvisation skills.
Adventure.End.Punk.1=Done and done\! Time to head back to Everod.
Adventure.End.Punk.2=Maybe I'll fight some agents on the way...ah. That'd be great.
Adventure.End.Punk.3=Nothing like a day's worth of work... it's weird saying stuff like that.
Adventure.End.Punk.4=Wonder if other Punks talk like that when they're by themselves...
Adventure.End.Punk.5=... Haha nah probably not, I'm super unique.
Adventure.End.Punk.6=... Why did that just happen? Why do I feel sick? Why didn't I enjoy this fight?
Adventure.End.Punk.7=... It was so strong and after beating it I only feel like...
Adventure.End.Punk.8=WHOA another day another surprise. I love being a Punk\!
Adventure.End.Punk.9=Even if I don't feel that great right now... weird. Maybe big sis know what's up? I'll head back.
Adventure.End.RAgent.1=I did it. Without being an agent even. See?
Adventure.End.RAgent.2=You don't need to be part of a bigger whole... it's enough to just be yourself.
Adventure.End.RAgent.3=Del I'm sorry... I didn't mean to leave. Please take me back.
Adventure.End.RAgent.4=Please take me back... please take... whoa...ok is this my punishment?
Adventure.End.RPunk.1=I've got them all to myself. Now. What am I supposed to do with this thing?
Adventure.End.RPunk.2=CRESS?? CRESS ARE YOU HERE??? I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS COME-
Adventure.End.RPunk.3=Hey this place is giving me the Heebie Jeebies. Wait why am I not in uniform?
Adventure.End.Rozu.1=I did it again.
Adventure.End.Rozu.10=... Wait. Is this the place my nan used to talk about? WOW I need to sit down...
Adventure.End.Rozu.11=Why am I so exhausted... oh probably because of those stairs...
Adventure.End.Rozu.12=The other Noise Hunters would never believe me if I told them about this place...
Adventure.End.Rozu.13=... But Cress will definitely be interested in this.
Adventure.End.Rozu.2=Finished a mission without anybody complaining about me looking stupid or being clumsy...
Adventure.End.Rozu.3=... or... did I actually just do a good job?
Adventure.End.Rozu.4=Crimson Force has taken such good care of me... without them even realizing it
Adventure.End.Rozu.5=I'll repay the favor by doing the best I can. Even if back home nobody deems that acceptable.
Adventure.End.Rozu.6=Spark said Punks are much cooler than the stuffy Noise Hunters...
Adventure.End.Rozu.7=l can't help feeling attached to my people... but maybe there's room in my heart for another family.
Adventure.End.Rozu.8=Wow. That was no Noise. It was something much much worse...
Adventure.End.Rozu.9=Why can't I shake the feeling that I didn't really defeat it though...?
Adventure.End.Spark.1=G-O-T EM\! That was easier than I thought\! Maybe I've got time for another mission?
Adventure.End.Spark.10=Done\! I'm probably the only Crimson Force member who was able to do this mission hehe.
Adventure.End.Spark.11=Reminds me of the days I used to fight criminals in the street... wait I'm still doing that...
Adventure.End.Spark.12=But now I don't fight Punks... all that often.
Adventure.End.Spark.13=I... I can't do this anymore I feel so weak, who cares about fighting or about helping others when everything is so...
Adventure.End.Spark.14=... Hold up. Where am I? Is this another challenge?
Adventure.End.Spark.15=Can't wait to take it on... or maybe I'll skip this one for once... where is the exit?
Adventure.End.Spark.2=Hm, Fin is probably waiting for me already... well here's hoping I find some Agents along the way.
Adventure.End.Spark.3=Been too long since my last fight haha.
Adventure.End.Spark.4=Aw yeah. Another day, another Ebit\! Hopefully more than one though. Mama needs a new hat\!
Adventure.End.Spark.5=Fighting with this thing on is tough...my old master is still ringing in my ear though about "this being tradition"...
Adventure.End.Spark.6=... And "monks mustn't forget their connections to Gaia" and "stop stealing from the monastery"...
Adventure.End.Spark.7=I do miss them sometimes.
Adventure.End.Spark.8=Whew almost broke a sweat there haha. If mastress could see me now... what would they think?
Adventure.End.Spark.9=... Eh they'd probably throw some pines at me or something.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.1=Welcome. Would you like to test your might young one?
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.10=Good luck on your travels.
Adventure.Event.Crushlord.11=So every bone in alphabetical or in areal order?\nOh I'm talking about how you'd like to get crushed.

Adventure.Event.Gunslinger.9=Can't beat me huh? Get faster first, then challenge me again.
Adventure.Event.Hooded.1=These battles... they lost meaning to me...
Adventure.Event.Hooded.2=An enemy?
Adventure.Event.Hooded.3=... Let's go.
Adventure.Event.Hooded.4=This is getting boring...
Adventure.Event.Hooded.5=Such strength...\!\!\! Yet... you left me alive. Was it mercy? Or was it something else...
Adventure.Event.Hooded.6=Let me repay you with this.
Adventure.Event.Hooded.7=You can rely on me when you're in a pinch. I am no hero, but I will fight for you.
Adventure.Event.Hurt.1=Ouch... hey... a noise got me good... could you please help me?
Adventure.Event.Hurt.2=Phew... thank you so much\! Here's a thank you gift\!

Adventure.Event.Rescued.11=Wow. I don't know what is happening but thanks little data freak.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.12=Soo you saved me?\nYou of course won't respond you're just a Noise.\nWell I'll just run while you're staring at nothing.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.13=... Can you understand me? Wait, you're a noise of course you can't... I should go before it gets aggressive.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.14=D-did you just heal me? I-I've never seen a Noise helping people... do you want uh food? Here.\nCan you eat that?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.15=Are you trying to help? Wow... a helpful noise hahaha, how mysterious. Take this little snack.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.16=What? A noise that not only rescues but heals? I must be hallucinating. \nThen it won't matter if I give you this family heirloom of mine.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.17=A noise rescued me today... Guess you see all kinds of things in Anikka huh? Want some data, little guy?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.18=Unbelievable, a non-hostile noise? What if I were to give it a treat?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.19=Nobody will ever believe that a noise helped me out...
Adventure.Event.Rescued.2=Phew, you saved my butt. Please take this, it's a token of my appreciation.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.20=Hahahaha, a rescuing noise... what the heck.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.21=I really am dreaming huh? Time to go pinch everyone's cheeks haha\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.22=I'll remember you, maybe if we see each other again I could adopt you?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.23=Wow, it just gobbled that straight up. I should get going, but... take care?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.24=Wow I was in a real pickle there\! I always knew I could trust Azure Shield to protect us normal citizens.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.25=... Even if others might not think that... anyways take this as thanks\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.26=I know you're not allowed to take bribes... but are "thank you" gifts ok?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.27=I won't tell anyone if you don't\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.28=Azure... Shield? I thought you were the bad guys... maybe I should check my facts.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.29=Oh... I actually wanted a Punk to save me... guess I might as well give this to you.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.3=Wow, you came in clutch\! Thank you so much, take this\!\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.30=Why would a giant corporation save a little gal like me? Well, take this.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.31=You looked SO stylish while saving me. I'd be honored if you took this item.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.32=What was that funky tune playing in the background while you fought?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.33=... That was you?? Well here's your tip.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.34=Oh you're... I know you probably don't need this, but I want you to have it anyway.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.35=Hey didn't you create that one game everybody used to play?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.36=That game was my childhood, please take this as a gift from a fan\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.37=Wow I always thought the famous Delicia worked in a stuffy office building. Maybe you could use this on your quest?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.38=OH MY GOD YOU'RE DELICIA\! CAN YOU SIGN THIS FOR ME???
Adventure.Event.Rescued.39=Your arm is SO cool. Do you have any use for something like this?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.4=I'll tell my people at home about you\! Thank you again.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.40=Aren't you like... a big tech mogul? I don't trust you but... have this anyway.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.41=Azure Shield right? Y'all are shady as heck... but thank you for helping me.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.42=Eek\! ...Oh you don't want my money? Sorry I'm so used to getting robbed by Punks...
Adventure.Event.Rescued.43=Please take this as an apology-gift\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.44=Wow a real-life Punk. I always thought you guys and gals were the real deal.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.45=I hope this little gift will help you help others\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.46=Ack\! A punk\! Help\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.47=Woow, I've never seen anyone using their fists like that... I'll use mine to throw this gift at you HYA\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.48=So you Punks help people now? What happened to you? I thought you guys were cool.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.49=We've gotten an upgrade.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.5=You're the best\! See you\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.50=Have another\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.51=My dad used to be a Punk. Now he's too old for that stuff though. He'd want you to have this\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.52=Yay\! You're a superhero\! I love you\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.53=You are an inspiration\! Please let me join the Punks\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.54=Sure. How do we contact you?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.55=I wrote my contact information on this - see ya\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.56=How do I learn to fight like you??? You looked so dope\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.57=I think you could use this to improve your skills though.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.58=Your hair\! Your freaking hair\! I'm gonna grow it out like you and also become a superhero\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.59=There's an easier way - just join my crew.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.6=I'm in your debt. Hope I can repay it a little with that.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.60=Sounds good\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.61=Is this the power of the Punks? Well here's your reward\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.62=Isn't this whole get-up a bit... tacky? Put this on, it'll look nice on you.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.63=You're the leader of those ruffians right? Geez what are you thinking...
Adventure.Event.Rescued.64=But a good deed is a good deed. Have this.
Adventure.Event.Rescued.7=I have to go home now, but I'm really grateful to you. Goodbye\!
Adventure.Event.Rescued.8=... you have a conscience?
Adventure.Event.Rescued.9=A-a-a-a another one?\! HELP\! Someone\!\!\!
Adventure.Fin.Punk.1=N-no thanks... I already have a full-time job protecting someone.
Adventure.Fin.Punk.2=You're a bodyguard? Guess anyone can be one with a Voxel Generator hahaha\!
Adventure.Fin.Tower.1=Uhm... where am I?
Adventure.Jeremy.Punk.1=No thanks, I do what I want.
Adventure.Jeremy.Punk.2=Right on\! Come see us if you change your mind.
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.1=I-I feel sick. This city's whole gravity rotation thing is giving me massive stomach ache.
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.2=Amazin'\! An entire city with outskirts... all inside a cave? And the city is spinnin'?\! Who thought of that???
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.3=Strange.. the outskirts here are littered with noises... I thought Astrat spins to shoo away noises?
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.4=If you turn Astrat around...it spells Tartsa. Which as we all know - sounds cool.
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.5=This city would make for great Crimson Force headquarters\! I heard the first Punks were born in Astratl\!
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.6=Lotsa people outside Astrat think we look intimidating and get scared, but we wear these outfits with pride\!
Adventure.Punk.Astrat.7=The peeps here in Astrat are really nice to us, we help 'em with a lotta things and they help us\! Give and take\!
Adventure.Punk.Beach.1=Hah, look at this view. Sucks to be the gang patrolling the Glacial Pathways harharhar\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Beach.2=Myste Edun... such a pretty and clean beach. Wonder who the caretakers are?
Adventure.Punk.Beach.3=Maybe the Noises in the water?
Adventure.Punk.Beach.5=The beach is nice... but I kinda don't wanna swim. There are monsters there.
Adventure.Punk.Beach.6=... We are literally surrounded by Noises at all times.
Adventure.Punk.Beach.7=Oh hey you're right\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.1=B-bro?
Adventure.Punk.Betray.2=I ain't your bro anymore\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.3=Hey nice hit bro\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.4=Now I present to you the consequences of your actions.
Adventure.Punk.Betray.5=I've had it with this bro-talk\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.6=You silly punks\! The world can't go on like this forever\! Azure Shield is right\!
Adventure.Punk.Betray.7=Get out of my way. It's time for me to join the agents.
Adventure.Punk.Betray.8=Why does Cress cling so to the past? It is time for a change\! My fists ache for the future\!
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.1=This whole place is confusing. Gears everywhere you look? I miss Astrat...
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.2=Ya know, there were always noises in this ol' factory, but never as many as now... Is it Azure's fault?
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.3=Yo, don't ya think this factory is gigantic? It might even be bigger than Everod or Harosh\!
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.4=The gears disturb some punks... but honestly all the clicking... and clacking... makes me sleepy... *snore*
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.5=We're just scoutin' out this place for Cress, once we're done we're gettin' the heck outta here.
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.6=Yo, this whole place is just too mechy for us Punks ya know? We like "to the point" kinda things way better\!
Adventure.Punk.Clocks.7=Preeeetty sure Azure is up to no good here. Beat some of 'em up for us if you see any yeah?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.1=Cress-sis\! I've got your coffee brewed and ready\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.10=What can I say? I think with my heart\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.11=Look at me I'm kicking with my fists\! ... Oh who am I kidding.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.12=Sister your hair looks like a cape.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.13=That's the idea.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.14=Oh.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.15=*I wonder if Delicias grunts talk to her like this...*
Adventure.Punk.Cress.16=Sis if you don't mind me asking... What is your goal in life?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.17=Oh. I should know that? Knowing that is essential to the mission?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.18=YOU SAY IT'S OK AND I SHOULD CALM DOWN?????
Adventure.Punk.Cress.2=...
Adventure.Punk.Cress.3=... Ok sorry. Next time I'll bring it in a cup and not in my... fists.
Adventure.Punk.Cress.4=Here are the beans you wanted Cress-sis\! Oh, you wanted liquid coffee?
Adventure.Punk.Cress.5=Here I juiced them with my fists for you\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.6=*CRUNCH\!*
Adventure.Punk.Cress.7="Delicious."
Adventure.Punk.Cress.8=I really admire how you punch with your feet\!
Adventure.Punk.Cress.9=You are a dumbo.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.1=I am so glad we have a canteen around here, I'd seriously dry out without it.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.10=We ain't scared of those Agent grunts or progress... but it just don't sit right with us.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.11=People shouldn't have to suffer... for any reason\!
Adventure.Punk.Desert.12=Cress-sis made sure we all know what Azure Shield is up to. Know Midius...?
Adventure.Punk.Desert.13=That used to be a bustling city... now it's gone. Same thing'll happen to all of Anikka we don't stop Azure.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.2=Ey, it's hot here sure, but the thing that makes me sweat more is seeing those Azure grunts...
Adventure.Punk.Desert.3=Yo, wanna listen to a story my parents used to tell me 'bout this place?
Adventure.Punk.Desert.4=Want to listen to the story?
Adventure.Punk.Desert.5=So get this, apparently the desert is alive\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Desert.6=I know, I hear you sayin' "but how?". Lemme let you in on the secret...
Adventure.Punk.Desert.7=Ghosts\!\!\! OooooOooOOOO, spooky\!\!\! They haunt this 'ere place\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Desert.8=Ya know, thinkin' back it was probably just made-up stories to scare the kids away from comin' here.
Adventure.Punk.Desert.9=No probs, just don't blame me when you see 'em\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.1=This one really doesn't know what they want.
Adventure.Punk.Double.10=Onward\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.11=I'm angry at you for beating up my bros and sisters...
Adventure.Punk.Double.12=... But I can't stay mad at someone who can beat agents so elegantly\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.13=And that is exactly the problem.
Adventure.Punk.Double.14=Are you trying to come back to the Force?
Adventure.Punk.Double.15=Just passing through.
Adventure.Punk.Double.16=What is your end goal here buddy?
Adventure.Punk.Double.17=What is yours?
Adventure.Punk.Double.18=Finishing the mission.
Adventure.Punk.Double.19=There is more to life than that
Adventure.Punk.Double.2=You betrayed us... then Azure Shield... what are you now?
Adventure.Punk.Double.20=What the heck are you talking about.
Adventure.Punk.Double.3=My own thing\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.4=You beat up some Punks... then some Agents... you're just a criminal then I suppose?
Adventure.Punk.Double.5=You are confusing me.
Adventure.Punk.Double.6=If you freeze a pond, and then heat it up... is it the same water as before or something entirely new?
Adventure.Punk.Double.7=The Punks and the Agents are just 2 different unmanagable extremes. We need a middle-way\!
Adventure.Punk.Double.8=Or I just punch you as hard as I can.
Adventure.Punk.Double.9=Up or down, left or right which is it traitor?
Adventure.Punk.Duel.1=Ah well, we'll take the L. And you can take this\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.10=Punching punching... always punching. How about... punchering?
Adventure.Punk.Duel.11=Will this struggle ever end...? Just kidding, let's keep it up. Have a bonus\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.12=Stronger than you thought huh? Get some power first before you challenge us again.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.13=Hah, that wasn't even a warm-up\! That all you got?
Adventure.Punk.Duel.14=Word of advice\: Try hitting me with your attacks.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.15=Friendly reminder\: Dodge attacks.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.16=Oof ok, I did not need to go all out like that I suppose. Sorry.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.17=Sorry next time tell me when you're ready.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.18=Ey bro no problem, I didn't know that this would be your first real fight\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.19=That really hit the spot\! Kinda gettin' hungry now.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.2=Good match\! Phew, I'm all tired out... Here's a reward for winning\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.20=I could do this all day\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.21=Getting proper rest is as important as the pump itself\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.22=Hey, watch it\! Oh\! Brozu\! You wanna show us some noise busting techniques? Let's go\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.23=Brozu, you want a fight? Then let's fight\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.24=AGH\! A surprise attack, you got us again Cress-sis\! We won't let our guard down again, now let's brawl\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.25=OH NO\! She's angry\! Get ready for a beating everyone...\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.26=Oh uh sorry... I want to test out some battle techniques Spark taught me...
Adventure.Punk.Duel.27=AH\! Yeah we know how... prickly she can be. Ok boy, let's battle\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.28=LETS DUEL\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.29=Hey man I've been having a rough day, and I do not appreciate us getting sucker punched by somebody I like.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.3=Darn I was aiming for the K.O. I mean... I was heading for the head.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.30=Oh no, I'm so sorry.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.31=I'm just playin', let's fight\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.32=YARGH\! Ey that hurt\! Oh we're sparring? Then have at thee\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.33=Hi Spark, nice attack. Could use some practice though.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.34=Nice use of that VOC\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.35=*Dang that wasn't intentional... eh let's make it look like it was*
Adventure.Punk.Duel.36=Let's see what they taught you at that monastery of yours\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.37=*Mainly not to attack without reason... whooops*
Adventure.Punk.Duel.38=Hey give me a gift.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.39=... Eeeeeeaaarn iiiiiiit I guess???
Adventure.Punk.Duel.4=This was supposed to be a friendly fight... but now I feel we are more than friends.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.5=The way you move... it makes me feel home. Thank you.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.6=Ey nice fight, have this\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.7=I stole this from an Agent hehe. Hide it for me will ya.
Adventure.Punk.Duel.8=Look what I found between my abs\!
Adventure.Punk.Duel.9=If you do enough push ups... the push up fairy will come and give you this\!
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.1=What made you change sides?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.10=She owes me five bucks\!
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.2=After fighting the Punks over and over again...
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.3=...I just realised that we're not ready yet to embark into an uncertain future.
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.4=Right on, dude\!
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.5=Sooo... what are the Azure Shield headquarters like?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.6=You want to know secret pathways or some passwords?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.7=Actually I just wanted to know if their HQ is heated... because ours ain't.
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.8=Ever met Del? What's she like?
Adventure.Punk.ExAgent.9=She's a good leader... we always knew what we had to do to finish the mission. And we got paid really well.\n... What is Cress like?
Adventure.Punk.Forest.1=You just gotta love the sounds of Nature, I just wish there were more animals...
Adventure.Punk.Forest.2=Ey, heard of the rumors? People are sayin' that almost all animals here were... eaten by Noises... sheesh\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.3=Takin' a hike like this, beatin' up noises and searching for lost treasure to help people... I LOVE BEING A PUNK\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.4=Punchin' trees... that's what it's all about baby.
Adventure.Punk.Forest.5=Have you considered joinin' the punks? The test is easy, just beat one or two of us up while Cress watches\! HAHAHA\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.6=Cress is amazing, she teaches us a lotta new things\! Like... waiting to see what VOCs the enemy has before attacking\!
Adventure.Punk.Forest.7=Before Cress rose to the top, we had strong punks like Flink tellin' us the drill... We're all happier now though\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.1=We have two motives in Crimson Force\: helping those in need and to stop Azure. If the going gets tough, turn to us\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.2=Oughta be careful round here, don't want any Azures to find our hideout... AGH, forget you heard anything\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.3=A lotta punks were sus of Cress leadin' us, but she proved that she's more of a punk than any of us\!
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.4=Yo, it's so cold here. Can't imagine how much colder it must be for those hot-climate-agents though.
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.5=Everod sure is tough. Just imagine, it snows here all-year long\! Where does all that even come from??
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.6=Being here makes me wish I'd be in the sunny beaches of Myste Edun instead... man.
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.7=I actually prefer the cold. It gives me a reason to wear my Cress socks...
Adventure.Punk.Glacial.8=Yeah of course I can knit you a pair\! Oh you didn't ask? That's ok I'll do it anyway.
Adventure.Punk.Ice.1=You know, for this being an ice-cave it sure feels warm. Gotta wonder why.
Adventure.Punk.Ice.2=All servers here are cooled by the ice, so we don't gotta pay for cooling\! ...Cress-sis is so smart\!
Adventure.Punk.Ice.3=Don't forget, shhhhhh\! Don't tell anyone about our hideout.
Adventure.Punk.Ice.4=Hideout? What hideout?
Adventure.Punk.Ice.5=I don't know\! What are you talking about?\!
Adventure.Punk.Ice.6=What are YOU talking about?\!
Adventure.Punk.Join.1=I'd love to be part of your squad and all but I'd feel like the third wheel.
Adventure.Punk.Join.2=Invite this punk to your party?
Adventure.Punk.Join.4=Man, I'm super bored. Wish I could switch posts...
Adventure.Punk.Join.5=If you were a Punk too I could go adventuring with you... Ah well\!
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.1=Wait... did you turn on your own gang? That's cold dude.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.2=So you want to be a punk? Well I don't see any reason not to trust you.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.3=I'll let you join us... IF you write a theme song for me.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.4=What is Cress's policy on Azure recruits? Oh, she says we'll take what we can get? 
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.5=Hey wanna join us?
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.6=YES FINALLY\!\!\!
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.7=No ew you smell.
Adventure.Punk.RAgent.8=... So?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.1=How do I take on a giant QT?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.10=Easy. The noise of a waffle maker.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.11=... I meant the digital ghost thingies.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.12=... Yeah me too. Gotta go\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.13=Cress has been going out more often to fight Noises on her own.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.14=She's training.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.15=Well you said that we should always be prepared for a Noise attack\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.16=*But at this rate she'll be more useful than me...*
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.17=Ey, who do you prefer? Spark or Cress?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.18=I don't understand the question.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.19=I mean who would you rather spar with?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.2=A... giant?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.20=Oh uh Spark I guess. Cress' kicks are a bit much for me.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.21=Tell me about it
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.22=What are Noise Hunter girls like?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.23=Uh... they're OK.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.24=Just asking cause I'm thinking of settling down and leading a cozy Noise Hunter lifestyle.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.25=Believe me, there's nothing cozy about it.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.26=*I do miss Snow Waffles though*
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.27=So what ARE Noises? Jammed data yeah but how could that possibly work?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.28=I told you last lesson.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.29=You did? Dang\! Why can't I remember\!?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.3=Yeah you know, those have been popping up from time to time.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.30=Hey Rozu can you lend me a scarf?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.31=Sorry, I lost mine yesterday.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.32=Hehe, that's a pity.
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.4=... Same way you beat a normal QT but... with bigger attacks?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.5=Wow\! Thanks Bro\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.6=How many Noises have you taken on in your time?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.7=Uh... millions\!
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.8=What is a million?
Adventure.Punk.Rozu.9=Rozu\! What is your favorite Noise?
Adventure.Punk.Socks.1=Yo, you already have some Cress socks? Wow, you're a real fan too huh\!?\nThey smell like coffee when you sweat. Just like her\!\n
Adventure.Punk.Socks.2=I hope these socks will help you be as fast as Cress\! I put lots of love into them\!
Adventure.Punk.Spark.1=Eey Spark-Girl what's poppin, ready to rumble? Yabadoodledeezle\!
Adventure.Punk.Spark.10=What about "punching Agents" ain't real?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.11=I see how you're trying to get stronger than Cress. But between us two...
Adventure.Punk.Spark.12=It's no coincidence she's our boss.
Adventure.Punk.Spark.13=Sooo you and that Fin guyyy are you two... interested in buying official Punk merch or nah?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.14=Are you still fighting crimes in the streets?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.15=...Oh, it's what we're all doing right now? Wait, where am I???
Adventure.Punk.Spark.16=You know what I appreciate about you Spark? You're just as dumb as us\!
Adventure.Punk.Spark.17=Rude?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.18=Rozu said you'd find it funny.
Adventure.Punk.Spark.19=Ey sister, where should we hide Rozu's scarf?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.2=... Did I say something wrong? Still trying to get into the Punk spirit...
Adventure.Punk.Spark.20=His scarf?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.21=Yeah, you told us to steal it from him as a prank.
Adventure.Punk.Spark.22=... Oh yeah I did. I dunno give it to an Agent, they look cold.
Adventure.Punk.Spark.23=PLANT GIRL WHASSUP\!

Adventure.Punk.Spark.5=Oh? ...What's up with your hat?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.6=Spark, you NEED to tell me how you were able to beat Rozu the other day\!\!
Adventure.Punk.Spark.7=... What do you mean he's not that strong?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.8=Sooo are you also just doing this to punch some Agents?
Adventure.Punk.Spark.9=No, I've got real reasons.
Adventure.Punk.Tower.1=Another day, another surprise. The life of a Punk is never boring\!
Adventure.Punk.Traitor.1=Well, well, well. If it ain't the traitor. Get them\!
Adventure.Punk.Traitor.2=Hey, we gotta get you to Cress. You'll answer for what you did.
Adventure.Punk.Traitor.3=Oh... tsk, you all know what we have to do right? Prepare for battle.
Adventure.Punk.Traitor.4=Why? Why would you betray us? I told you we'd install a heater at HQ soon\!
Adventure.PunkAzure.1=Hey bros, get a load of this dunce thinking they're hot stuff.

Adventure.PunkSupply.6=Hey, you look roughed up. Maybe this will help.
Adventure.PunkSupply.7=Ain't much, but we have to share\!
Adventure.RAgent.Del.1=Ah, a traitor.

Adventure.RAgent.Del.11=WOW\! How did I... I mean, haha vile villain\! You never stood a chance\!
Adventure.RAgent.Del.12=You are on the wrong side of history. I hope I can still save you.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.13=Oh boy. Please don't get mad.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.14=You've bested me... we'll meet again I'm sure.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.15=Guess you should've stuck to coding video games instead of becoming a big evil tech mogul\!
Adventure.RAgent.Del.16=You're playing with fire. If you go on you'lll see why I must win. Goodbye.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.2=Your company sickens me\!
Adventure.RAgent.Del.3=I do not care. If you stand in our way... then you have no one to blame but yourself..
Adventure.RAgent.Del.4=A fair warning. You won't win this fight.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.5=I got out of Azure Shield because I saw potential in myself\!
Adventure.RAgent.Del.6=You've wasted enough of my time.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.7=Another betraying Agent. I know who you are.
Adventure.RAgent.Del.8=I... you won't get past me chief... I mean Delicia\!
Adventure.RAgent.Del.9=Move.
Adventure.RAgent.Tower.1=Whoa, ok... is this my punishment?

Agent.1.3=Looks like it.
Agent.1.4=H-hi\!
Agent.1.5=Hello. Let's get right to it.
Agent.1.6=Before you can join us, you\nneed to prove your skills.
Agent.1.7=But first, tell us why you\nwant to be one of us.
Agent.1.8=My... our world is suffering\! There just aren't enough resources... if Azure Shield succeeds we can help everyone\!
Agent.1.9=We can provide infinite food\nand water to everyone\!

Agent.2.11=Hahahahaha\!
Agent.2.2=Did you not listen to\nthe general?\nYou're the worst\!
Agent.2.3=C'mon just tell me. Without\nme you won't be able to\nfinish this job either.
Agent.2.4=It's a simple scouting mission.\nIt's best if you don't get\ninvolved, so just stay behind...
Agent.2.5=No reason to be rude.
Agent.2.6=Shoot\!\nI knew we should've\ndisguised ourselves\!
Agent.2.7=Sarah are you ok?\nYou look hurt.

Agent.5.1=Agent Echs, how many troops\nare left in the factory?
Agent.5.10=Well WE made it in time.
Agent.5.11=Were you behind all this?
Agent.5.12=Destroy the central Voxel Generator \nimmediately so that no new Noises will \nspawn.
Agent.5.2=They're all severly wounded,\nI'm the only one left\!\nNoises are spilling into the streets\!
Agent.5.3=All outside Agents are\nneeded for Operation "Godius"...
Agent.5.4=We're leaving it to you to \nstop the Noise outbreak.
Agent.5.5=I did it\! Now to clear all the Noises\nthat are endangering civilians...
Agent.5.6=The heroes have come\nto save the day\!
Agent.5.7=Huh?
Agent.5.9="Heroes"? Because of you, our\ntroops couldn't make it in time.

CF.2.5=What is up with that girl??? She'll get us in trouble\!
CF.2.52=Yah. For sure. We'll make her regret that. Me included we still got 20 Punks left\!

CF.3.1.14=You can leave these skellies to me\!
CF.3.1.15=If you say so...
CF.3.1.2=Ugh. This village doesn't have any Noise protection installed. That's why.
CF.3.1.3=Shouldn't Noise Hunters be... taking care of that?
CF.3.1.4=Well obviously an isolated place like this shouldn't be getting any Noises in the first place.
CF.3.1.5=Ok mr. grumpy pants sorry for asking I guess. Is that a Noise?
CF.3.1.6=No, that's a couch.
CF.3.1.7=Is that a Noise?
CF.3.1.8=Rock.
CF.3.1.9=Wow, being a Noise Hunter is tough\!
CF.3.2.1=Well if this Crimson Force thing doesn't work out I might just join your hunting clan instead, haha.
CF.3.2.10=We call you that already.
CF.3.2.102=But the other hunters don't\!
CF.3.2.11=But back at home they don't.
CF.3.2.112=We've been partners for over a month now....
CF.3.2.12=Oh. I never asked but... why did they kick you out?
CF.3.2.122=Feels a lot longer....
CF.3.2.13=Nice\! If that Crimson Force thing doesn't work out I might just join your clan instead\!
CF.3.2.132=...but I never asked\: Why do the Noise Hunters not want you there?
CF.3.2.15=They caught me with my neighbour.
CF.3.2.152=...well maybe they have a good reason?
CF.3.2.16=Smoochin'?
CF.3.2.17=... Who is a dude.
CF.3.2.18=Sooo... you were a' smoochin'?
CF.3.2.19=Yes my father caught us... kissing.
CF.3.2.2=... It's not really MY tribe anymore.
CF.3.2.20=Very cool story man. But I asked why they kicked you out.
CF.3.2.21=I... I just told you. I'm gay.
CF.3.2.210=... well it's not really MINE anymore....
CF.3.2.22=Uh?
CF.3.2.23=Please don't tell Cress and the others....
CF.3.2.24=Haha dude, they already know. Everyone does.
CF.3.2.25=What???
CF.3.2.26=Yeah, so Amari from accounting asked if you were single and I said "ye" and he said "that's great" and I told him to back off since he isn't your type, I know you prefer smoother dudes and he got upset so I...
CF.3.2.27=WHAT\!\!\!
CF.3.2.28=And then I said "Try a shave" and boy he really didn't like that and I said "OK then don't even bother" and then Cress came along and
CF.3.2.29=WHAT???
CF.3.2.3=But you wear their uniform?
CF.3.2.30=... and Cress told him that he should definitely shave not just for your sake and then Tim came along and he thought that HE might have a shot but I laughed and sauf
CF.3.2.31=S P A R K
CF.3.2.32=Ye?
CF.3.2.33=How'd you know?
CF.3.2.34=Uh, dunno. Guess I just know how you feel.
CF.3.2.35=And Cress doesn't mind?
CF.3.2.36=But you still wear their uniform?
CF.3.2.38=Wow, these Noise Hunters really had it backwards didn't they.
CF.3.2.39=... Well...
CF.3.2.4=Well I hope that I'll earn my name back somehow.
CF.3.2.40=Let's go home Brozu.
CF.3.2.41=Sounds good yeah.
CF.3.2.42=Well....I'm hoping to earn my name back someday.
CF.3.2.5=Oh? What's your name?
CF.3.2.52=What is your name?
CF.3.2.6=Rozu.
CF.3.2.62=Rozu
CF.3.2.7=Rozu?
CF.3.2.72=Rozu?
CF.3.2.8=Rozu.
CF.3.2.82=Rozu
CF.3.2.9=I KNOW YOUR NAME IS ROZU\!
CF.3.2.92=But we call you that already\!
CF.4.1=Fin don't worry. It's gonna be fun\!
CF.4.10=Understood.
CF.4.11=Spark.
CF.4.12=Decoy-duty let's go\!
CF.4.13=Let's hope this works... destroying this factory might be our last chance to untangle this mess.
CF.4.2=This isn't supposed to be fun.
CF.4.3=Listen to Rozu\!
CF.4.3.1=Nice, another day another ebi-
CF.4.3.2=What was that? Why is my Voxel Generator making that noise?
CF.4.3.3=Spark\!
CF.4.3.4=Everod... Fin...he's...they're... it's all gone\!
CF.4.4=I listen to no one\! Now give your brother a big fat kiss on his cheek for me and lemme work\! Love you\!
CF.4.5=Wait what? Spark I love y-
CF.4.6=*beep*
CF.4.7=You good?
CF.4.8=Let's do this\!
CF.4.9=Rozu. Go take care of the Noise-Generator.
CF.5.2=Later...
CF.5.6.1=Operation "Everod" has been carried out succesfully.
CF.5.6.2=No traces of any living being remain. This town never existed.
CF.5.6.3=Oh yeah they fought valiantly. Not that it matters.
CF.5.6.4=Now how about we grab some lunch? My treat, Del dear.
CF.5.6.5=Sounds good... but first I'll send the leader of Crimson Force to her Punks.
Call=Connecting to endpoint... Dialing....
Cherry.VS.Misc.1=CreAM cREAM.
Cherry.VS.Misc.2=VaNILla... strAWBeRrY..... CHOCOLaTE.
Cherry.VS.Misc.3=TaSTe mE.
Cress.VS.Agent.1=Don't you dare play a battle theme right now.
Cress.VS.Agent.2=I am playing it as we speak\!
Cress.VS.Cress.1=An imitator? Wanna do my job for me?
Cress.VS.Cress.2=No please, you can keep your job. I just wanna fight.
Cress.VS.Del.1=You’ve got some nerve coming here.
Cress.VS.Del.2=If words don’t work… actions must follow.
Cress.VS.Fin.1=Come to get my autograph?
Cress.VS.Fin.2=I was uh... looking for Spark.
Cress.VS.Misc.1=You’ve got some nerve showing up.
Cress.VS.Misc.2=I'll 360° you easy.
Cress.VS.Misc.3=Lightning? No, those are just my feet.
Cress.VS.Misc.4=Buddy, you could never pass as a Punk.
Cress.VS.Noise.1=Let's clear you out before the Punks wake up.
Cress.VS.Noise.2=You are ugly. Just so you know.
Cress.VS.Noise.3=I knew I'd find some pests lurking here.
Cress.VS.Noise.4=I like Noises like I like my coffee\: Ground.
Cress.VS.Punk.1=Your punch VS my kicks let's go\!
Cress.VS.Punk.2=Break a leg boss.
Cress.VS.Rozu.1=Let's go Noise Hunter\!
Cress.VS.Rozu.2=I'll do my best\!
Cress.VS.Spark.1=Are you sure you can handle this heat?
Cress.VS.Spark.2=This'll be over before your kicks can connect\!
Cress.VS.Yven.1=Wait, who are you?
Cress.VS.Yven.2=Your undoing.
Cress.WIN.Misc.1=Now step aside.
Cress.WIN.Misc.2=You should see me after my morning brew.
Crimson.Force.2.1=Immediately after the desert incident...
Crimson.Force.2.2=This little maneuver cost us way too many Punks... how many are left?
Crimson.Force.2.3=I was the only one Del wasn't able to catch...
Crimson.Force.2.4=Darn\! If you got out of there it's because she wanted you to.
Crimson.Force.2.5=21\!
Crimson.Force.2.6=Wow. I've never seen anybody come a week late to their job.
Crimson.Force.2.7=I'm here, that's what counts. Tell me what to do\!
Crimson.Force.2.8=Rozu, go and show her the ropes. We'll need some time to regroup...
Crimson.Force.2.9=Roger.
Crimson.Force.5.1.1=Alright gang let's head out\!
Crimson.Force.5.1.2=Are these patrols really necessary?
Crimson.Force.5.1.3=Cress, Spark and Rozu are attacking that factory. Azure Shield should be busy but... you can never be too careful.
Crimson.Force.5.1.4=Flink admit it, you just want to visit your girlfriend.
Crimson.Force.5.1.5=You're right. I can see it in their eyes\!
Crimson.Force.5.1.6=Ey you're a bum, you know that? Get ready everyone, let's have a safe and chill patrol.
Crimson.Force.5.1.7=Afterwards I'm getting some hot buns\!
Crimson.Force.5.1.8=I bet you are.
Crimson.Force.5.1.9=Har har har\!
Crimson.Force.5.3.1=Well, that was a waste of time.
Crimson.Force.5.3.10=NOISES ARE APPROACHING EVEROD\! EVERYBODY MOVE\!
Crimson.Force.5.3.2=What is Cress-Sis even worried about?
Crimson.Force.5.3.3=There haven't been any Azure Agents here since Spark beat up those 2 avocados that got lost here.
Crimson.Force.5.3.4=How do you even get lost here? Everod is so far removed from any other city...
Crimson.Force.5.3.5=Ya have to have a reason to come to this frozen hole.
Crimson.Force.5.3.6=Yeah, but maybe we shouldn't have attacked their thing in response? Feels a bit extreme.
Crimson.Force.5.3.7=Maybe we should talk to them Azure guys and gals for once?
Crimson.Force.5.3.8=Wait. Did you hear that?
Crimson.Force.5.3.9=We just had to jinx it....
Crimson.Force.5.4.1=True that, but still... was it really necessary to attack them in the desert?
Crimson.Force.5.4.2=They killed Puppy, dude.
Crimson.Force.5.4.3=We have no idea what really happened. Don't forget we attacked first\! What if we just tried talking to-
Crimson.Force.5.4.4=Ah.
Crimson.Force.5.4.5=You just had to jinx it.
Crimson.Force.5.4.6=EVERYBODY MOVE\! DON'T LET THESE THINGS COME ANY CLOSER TO THE CITY\!\!\!\!
Crimson.Force.5.5.1=THERE ARE TOO MANY\! START EVACUATING THE CITY\!
Crimson.Force.5.5.2=ROGE-
Crimson.Force.C1A1.1=Whoa ok, ok I see not bad. Guess you weren't exiled for a lack of strength.
Crimson.Force.C1A1.2=That's none of your business.
Crimson.Force.C1A1.3=But do you know what IS my business?
Crimson.Force.C1A2.1=How do you know about that?
Crimson.Force.C1A2.2=Hey, It's time to guard much more than just the roads.
Del.VS.Agent.1=Let's have a brawl to go with this tea.
Del.VS.Agent.2=I'm so here for that\!
Del.VS.Cress.1=You're incredibly narrow minded.
Del.VS.Cress.2=Oh, you're one to talk\!
Del.VS.Del.1=What a cutie...
Del.VS.Del.2=Delicia stop, this must be a dream.
Del.VS.Fin.1=A young Everodian. Why would you fight against me?
Del.VS.Fin.2=Spark told me all about you guys... I won't let you through\!
Del.VS.Misc.1=If that's how it is, then we fight\!
Del.VS.Misc.2=Get out of my way.
Del.VS.Misc.3=Are you sure this is worth it?
Del.VS.Misc.4=You have no idea what's about to come.
Del.VS.Noise.1=Interesting.
Del.VS.Noise.2=How about I take you back to Azure HQ?
Del.VS.Noise.3=Ah this takes me back...
Del.VS.Noise.4=You won't even end up as a footnote in Azure's story.
Del.VS.Punk.1=Punks... I used to spar with your kind as a child.
Del.VS.Punk.2=You must've been a strong kid.
Del.VS.Rozu.1=Noise Hunter, soon Anikka won't be needing you anymore.
Del.VS.Rozu.2=If people start controlling Noises, I'll be needed more than ever.
Del.VS.Spark.1=Little monk-girl… get out of my way.
Del.VS.Spark.2=Nope, your way leads straight to me.
Del.VS.Yven.1=Nice of you to spar with me.
Del.VS.Yven.2=Girl, it's my pleasure\!
Del.WIN.Misc.1=As expected.
Del.WIN.Misc.2=Not bad. Are you looking for a job?
Del.WIN.Misc.3=A pity. Looks like you haven't prepared well.

Fin.VS.Agent.1=...Wait, are you Charles? Are we fighting again?
Fin.VS.Agent.2=I don't know what a “Charles” is, but I can fight.
Fin.VS.Cress.1=You look like that action figure Spark owns.
Fin.VS.Cress.2=She bought a Cress-doll? How embarrassing... for her.
Fin.VS.Del.1=Y-you want to hurt my friends. Then you'll have to get through m-me\!
Fin.VS.Del.2=I am aware.
Fin.VS.Fin.1=You look kinda scruffy... wait a minute.
Fin.VS.Fin.2=Let me give you... myself a haircut.
Fin.VS.Misc.1=Watch out, this Drill is a VXG\!
Fin.VS.Misc.2=I've crushed IceCubes that were tougher than you... I think.
Fin.VS.Misc.3=You look weaker than Spark. I can do this\!
Fin.VS.Misc.4=I'll fight if I have to\!
Fin.VS.Noise.1=Oooh, this is so cool. I wonder what data had to mix for you to spawn\!
Fin.VS.Noise.2=I'd love to analyse you but... you sadly need to get deleted.
Fin.VS.Noise.3=Oh\! You're just a Noise. Thought I’d actually have to fight a person.
Fin.VS.Noise.4=You're just some jumbled up program aren’t you... Alt+F4?
Fin.VS.Punk.1=Hey I saw you in Everod once\! Wait, why are you pointing a fist at me?
Fin.VS.Punk.2='Cause you're the only one here.
Fin.VS.Rozu.1=How do you properly fight Noises?
Fin.VS.Rozu.2=Pretty much like you'd fight a human. Lemme show you.
Fin.VS.Spark.1=I'm starting to enjoy our da- our training.
Fin.VS.Spark.2=Well then show me what you've learned\!
Fin.VS.Yven.1=Uh-Oh.
Fin.VS.Yven.2=Payback time\!
Fin.WIN.Misc.1=I did it\!\!\!
Fin.WIN.Misc.2=No way\! Training’s paying off\!
Fin.WIN.Misc.3=Oh, I hope I didn’t hurt you...

Punk.102=Huh?
Punk.103=REPORTING A HUGE-
Punk.104=AAAAAARGHG\!\!\!
Punk.105=Any of you find an entry?
Punk.106=Nope, they really don't want anyone snooping around there.
Punk.107=Some skimpy blue guys were walking the grounds. They were kinda hot.
Punk.108=Did ya fight them?
Punk.109=Ye we fought them.
Punk.11=I did after I beat all of you fair and square.
Punk.110=Hey. Has anyone seen Puppy?
Punk.111=Where is that silly rambling mess?
Punk.112=Her signal is gone...
Punk.113=HEY\!
Punk.114=GET AWAY FROM HERE\!
Punk.115=MAKE US\!
Punk.116=WATCH OUT\!\!\!
Punk.12=I don't trust ya, you're just some chick.
Punk.13=Well tough luck, if you want to stay part of the Punks you'll have to listen to this chick.
Punk.14=What are we even doing here? This place is weird.
Punk.15=Scared?
Punk.16=Annoyed.
Punk.17=Listen Flink. You're the strongest of the gang. I know a lot of you are sceptical about my goals...
Punk.18=WHAT are we doing exactly? You never talk about what you're planning. Why should we trust you?
Punk.19=It's no right to say this as a Punk but... being a better fighter doesn't make you stand above us\!
Punk.2=Ey\! You talking to me?
Punk.2.3.1.1=OK you've had your fun but now it's time to-
Punk.20=Calm down Flink.
Punk.21=No\! I've had it. Ya sucker punched us last time, but now I'm prepared. I'll settle this right now\!
Punk.22=... but trust me. I'm doing this for us all.
Punk.23=What?\! Oh what, no uh... I...
Punk.24=Brozu... please.
Punk.25=I'm telling you I barely know the basics...
Punk.26=Y'are the ONLY guy 'ere who can do it, we need your help. For Cress... sis.
Punk.27=Cress really hurt herself out there didn't she...
Punk.28=That ugly monster-thing did it\!
Punk.29=Noises aren't monsters they're just... data.
Punk.3=No\! But you're talking to me\!
Punk.30=... I talked back at her and still she protected me. She's still recovering from that... she's a proper Punk.
Punk.31=... I know a place where we can train.
Punk.32=So what are we supposed to do?
Punk.33=Well Noises are just jammed together data. There used to be an ice-cream factory and a petting zoo here sooo...
Punk.34=There he is.
Punk.35=He?
Punk.36=Uh "it" we call them Cherry.
Punk.37=What do I do?
Punk.38=Observe its pattern, that is the first rule. Noises are programs, they don't adapt...
Punk.39=... they have one fixed moveset they always use. Observe and... STRIKE FIRST\!
Punk.4=Ey\! I was talking\!
Punk.40=You did it\! Of course there are advanced techniques and strategies for every single Noise out there...
Punk.41=... but now you understand the basics\!
Punk.42=Brozu, can you teach me too?
Punk.43=And me?
Punk.44=How about us??
Punk.45=Whoa, whoa\! Let the man enjoy his coffee first.
Punk.46=What's this about coffee?
Punk.47=CRESS-SIS?\!
Punk.48=Once you understand that, something like this shouldn't happen again.
Punk.49=Gang, let's talk.
Punk.5=No\! It was me that was talking\!
Punk.50=Is it about tha plan?
Punk.51=What plan?
Punk.52=There's a plan?
Punk.53=There's a plan.
Punk.54=Let's talk about the plan.
Punk.55=What is... a plan?
Punk.56=It is... when you do more than just punch a thing to solve your problems.
Punk.57=Shooting is also ok, you see?
Punk.58=... LISTEN\! We're going on a trip. Not all of you, just the strongest ones and Rozu.
Punk.59=Uhm...
Punk.6=I DON'T THINK SO BUDDY\!
Punk.60=You're our Noise expert dummy. We need you on this one.
Punk.61=We'll go near Harosh not far from here. There have been way more Noise sightings than usual there...
Punk.62=... and I suspect D-... Azure Shield has something to do with it.
Punk.63=That posh tech-company?
Punk.64=Yeah. I've seen them work with Noises before and I don't like it.
Punk.66=A hot-... I mean a guy dressed for HOT climate was running around the Glacial Pathways with 2 Greeds\!
Punk.67=Doesn't bode well does it? The other team will go to Arahas Desert.
Punk.7=BUDDY? BUDDY???
Punk.70=Enter the site, don't get too close to the giant monster-looking thing...
Punk.71=UNDERSTOOD\!
Punk.72=THEN LET'S GO\!
Punk.73=Cress why didn't you go with the other team? This seems like a really chill... hike?
Punk.74=I want Azure Shield to concentrate their attention and security on their desert project for now.
Punk.75=There is no way we can stop what they're doing... not when they have some means of producing Noises.
Punk.76=THAT'S what they're doing?
Punk.77=It's what I suspect. And I suspect it a lot. So we need to stop that.
Punk.78=Cress-sis. Something is following us. Don't like it. Is it a good plan to, uh, punch it...?
Punk.79=That is a very good plan, yes.
Punk.8=You uh, wanna grab some grub?
Punk.80=Thank\! You\!
Punk.81=Do you think they've noticed us?
Punk.82=No way. Look at those meatbags, they don't notice anything.
Punk.83=FELLAS, I've got a plan\!
Punk.84=Plans are fun\!
Punk.85=Hey, what did I miss?
Punk.86=They... they built a Noise factory\!
Punk.87=This will require one hell of a plan...
Punk.88=... and leave immediately. Make it look like you're just doing... punk stuff.
Punk.89=Azure Shield is working on something there. All I want you to do is create some ruckus there.
Punk.9=Absolutely\!
Punk.90=Ya heard Cress\! Let's crush their camp from multiple sites\!
Punk.91=What if we get caught?
Punk.92=Well Puppy what do ya usually do when someone does something you don't like?
Punk.93=Shoot VOCs with my knuckles?
Punk.94=And what are ya gonna do when somebody is trying to catch ya?
Punk.95=Oh\! I get it now\! Punches\! Thanks big sis\!
Punk.96=Spread out and meet up back 'ere in 2 hours\!
Punk.97=Aye\!
Punk.98=Brozu prepared me for this\!
Punk.99=Oh. Okay. For Cress-sis\!
Punk.Trap.2.1.1=I hope that didn't hurt TOO bad. 
Punk.Trap.2.1.2=Owch. It did\!
Punk.Trap.2.1.3=You're just going to leave us here? There are Noises about\!
Punk.Trap.2.1.4=My agents will come and pick you up. We'll talk more at my HQ. See you there\!
Punk.VS.Agent.1=Agent detected, opinion rejected\!
Punk.VS.Agent.2=Hey now.
Punk.VS.Cress.1=You beat all the Punks once, but can you beat me again?
Punk.VS.Cress.2=Yes.
Punk.VS.Del.1=You're our enemy\! I'll fight ya for Cress-sis\!
Punk.VS.Del.2=Enemy shmenemy. We'll all live with the choices of the winner.
Punk.VS.Fin.1=A random boy wants to brawl? Fine with me\!
Punk.VS.Fin.2=*I'm pretty sure this Punk knows me.*
Punk.VS.Misc.1=Lend me a hand? Or a fist?
Punk.VS.Misc.2=Rock, scissors, paper\! ...How'd you know I'd pick rock?
Punk.VS.Misc.3=Let's punk\!
Punk.VS.Misc.4=*cracks knuckles* …Now let's crack yours.
Punk.VS.Noise.1=Let's see what punching data feels like.
Punk.VS.Noise.2=Bro, you look ripped.
Punk.VS.Noise.3=Are you edible? Just asking bro.
Punk.VS.Noise.4=You won't get in Cress-sis’ way\!
Punk.VS.Punk.1=Bro, you ‘mirin?
Punk.VS.Punk.2=Let's get shredded... together\!
Punk.VS.Rozu.1=Brozu\! Let's go Noise hunting\!
Punk.VS.Rozu.2=We should warm up first\!
Punk.VS.Spark.1=Plant girl\! This time I'll beat ya\!
Punk.VS.Spark.2=Good\! I like beets... get it?
Punk.VS.Yven.1=Are you new?

R&B.1.1.1=You’ve built an entire school?
R&B.1.1.10=Are you sure you don’t want to teach as well? We could use someone for the history classes...\r
R&B.1.1.11=Noo haha I really don’t want anything to do with authority.\r
R&B.1.1.12=Just leave me to my books and my Voxel-Tournaments thank you very much.
R&B.1.1.2=My childhood in Midius was… messy.
R&B.1.1.3=So I want to give all the kids there the same opportunities you and Dad gave me.
R&B.1.1.4=You just needed a hand is all. 
R&B.1.1.5="A hand"?
R&B.1.1.6=You know what I mean. When we took you in... dad already knew you'd turn out great.
R&B.1.1.7=The kids attending our Midius-Program are also full of potential.
R&B.1.1.8=I am really excited to see how they’re gonna change the world.
R&B.1.1.9=With you as their teacher I’m sure they're gonna cause an uproar\!\r

R&B.1.3.1=Hey you three\!
R&B.1.3.2=Why were you trying to rob us?
R&B.1.3.3=I just... couldn’t see another way to provide for my kids.
R&B.1.3.4=You fought well… go to the Azure Shield base near here. We might have a job for you and your buddies.
R&B.1.3.5=Ok... we’ll think about it. Sarah, Echs... let’s go.
R&B.1.3.6=You got it Vanessa.
R&B.1.4.1=Wow, saving the world even in your spare time huh?
R&B.1.4.2=Well people hunger in their spare time… gotta do what I can.
R&B.1.4.3=For most it’s getting harder and harder these days to feed themselves, let alone others.
R&B.1.4.4=I appreciate you still taking time for your big sis.
R&B.1.4.5=Well I need to remember what I’m fighting for don't I.
R&B.1.4.6=You are SO corny.

R&B.1.5=*beep beep beep*
R&B.1.6.1=What's up?
R&B.1.6.2=Some… strange readings coming from Midius. We better go there fast.
R&B.1.6.3=You got it\!
R&B.2.1.1=Midius is just up ahead right?
R&B.2.1.2=Yes but...
R&B.2.2.1=There aren’t supposed to be any Noises here. Azure Shield put up Noise protection all over the place.
R&B.2.2.2=Noises in the middle of desert… something is wrong.
R&B.2.2.3=Come on… let’s delete them.
R&B.2.3=Midius is just up ahe-
R&B.3.1=Del... are you ok?
R&B.3.10.1=Hey\! Del do you know this person?

R&B.3.10.7=The end of all Godi of course.
R&B.3.11.1=You again\!
R&B.3.11.2=Yes I work here.
R&B.3.11.3=Cress if you want to help Azure Shield you need to get along with Yven.
R&B.3.11.4=Because without him... THIS wouldn’t be possible. 
R&B.3.12=Q.T., shoot this rock\!
R&B.3.13.1=We're finally able to reach the monster that has destroyed Midius back then...
R&B.3.13.2=... Be careful Del.
R&B.3.13.3=I always am.
R&B.3.14.1=I can't believe it… if I’m correct this must be "Exerian"…
R&B.3.14.2=It's even uglier than I imagined.
R&B.3.14.3=Scientists of old have created this creature and its siblings as a way of generating infinite resources...
R&B.3.14.4=One Godius for each nation. But soon they discovered that true infinity cannot be reached with just one.
R&B.3.14.5=Instead of working together -or even just compromising- the Godi were repurposed as war machines.
R&B.3.14.6=And so the nations tried to steal each others Godius... thus all of Anikka fell.\r
R&B.3.15.1=We are in the middle of a new crisis...
R&B.3.15.2=Resources are running out and the soil isn’t strong enough to feed everyone.
R&B.3.15.3=People are starting to get suspicious of their neighbours.
R&B.3.15.4=We must end the cycle of violence before it can begin.
R&B.3.15.5=True, true... anyways this thing is giving me the creeps... hurry up Del.
R&B.3.15.6=Yven… Cress… Operation "Godius" starts now.
R&B.3.16.1=You'll have to weaken it first it seems.
R&B.3.16.2=Well good thing we're ARMED. Amirite sister?
R&B.3.16.4=...I thought that was a good joke.
R&B.3.17.1=IT WORKED\!\!\!
R&B.3.17.2=It really did\! Your sister came in quite HANDY Del.
R&B.3.17.3=Haha, good one Yven\!
R&B.3.17.4=Hey\! Wait …what worked? The arm is still there.
R&B.3.17.5=Yes and I was able to command it\!
R&B.3.2.1=Del?
R&B.3.2.2=I'm... not ok. What was that thing?
R&B.3.3.1=It looked like a Godius...\nbut that can’t be...
R&B.3.3.2=Were the people in Midius\nstill there when it attacked?
R&B.3.3.3=... Let’s get you out of here.\nWe'll talk at home.
R&B.3.4=A month later...
R&B.3.5.1=Hey, I brought you something\!
R&B.3.5.2=Uh-huh.
R&B.3.5.3=Have you gone outside today?
R&B.3.6.1=It's a beautiful day. Come on, I'll take you to Myste Edun.
R&B.3.6.2=… Maybe later.
R&B.3.6.3=… Ok, I'll come back in a few hours… promise me you'll at least get out of bed until then.
R&B.3.7.1=Two months later...
R&B.3.7.2=*beep beep beep*
R&B.3.7.3=Hey there. How’s your depression going today?
R&B.3.7.4=... Uhm.
R&B.3.7.5=... Too soon for jokes huh. Sorry. I'll call you again next week.
R&B.3.8=One year later...
R&B.3.9=Haven’t visited her this month… let’s see how she’s holding up.
R&B.4.1.1=Are you crazy?\!
R&B.4.1.2=I know what you're saying but-
R&B.4.1.3=But what? Everything we know about the Godi, and everything we don't tells us that we shouldn't be messing around with them.
R&B.4.1.4=Sister, it's a safe process. With Exerian we can destroy the other 9 Godi. But first we can use it-
R&B.4.1.5=Del. Read a history book for once will you. Any historian will tell you that-
R&B.4.1.6=The Godi were invented because people were scared of their world ending...
R&B.4.1.7=Well I can see the world dying right before my eyes\! Resources are running out, people are barely affording the bread on their tables...
R&B.4.1.8=It's not only about destroying the Godi. With this technology we won't just save the world...
R&B.4.1.9=We can finally end the cycle that turns people against each other\!
R&B.4.2.1=This isn't the way to do it sister. We can do this together. With my knowledge and your technology-
R&B.4.2.2=You can't see it yet but... people are starving and the Godi are about to awaken for good.
R&B.4.2.3=The last one was just a glimpse at what's to come.
R&B.4.2.4=I don't want anyone suffering like I... am.
R&B.4.2.5=There is no time to search for an alternative. This is the only way.
R&B.4.2.6=...There is always another way...
R&B.4.3=Some time later...
R&B.4.4.1=Huh?
R&B.4.4.2=Aight boys let's destroy this thing, I got a girl waiting for me at home\!
R&B.4.4.3=I'm your girlfriend\!
R&B.4.4.4=You're here???
R&B.4.5.1=HEY\! GET AWAY FROM THERE\!
R&B.4.5.2=Make us\!
R&B.4.5.3=Ma'am, allow me to aid you.
R&B.4.6.1=You can beat us but you'll never break our spirits\!
R&B.4.6.2=I don't care about your spirit. Go home.
R&B.4.6.4=I'm sure your "leader" needs you.
R&B.4.6.5=tsk
R&B.4.7.1=Ma'am don't you want to interrogate them?
R&B.4.7.2=No. I know everything I need to know.
R&B.4.8.1=Cress, don't send your friends again or you'll regret it.
R&B.4.8.3=I told you that it's the only way. Why don't you-
R&B.4.8.4=*Beep*
R&B.5.1.1=All of Everod… my punks… they’re...
R&B.5.1.10=By AWAKENING them? Are you listening to yourself?\r
R&B.5.1.11=We can’t keep living in fear\! 
R&B.5.1.12=You should see the work we’ve done with Exerian. We’ve been able to generate food out of thin air-
R&B.5.1.13=Don't you remember what Exerian did to YOUR people just with ONE arm?\r
R&B.5.1.14=What happened to Midius… it could have been prevented.
R&B.5.1.15=I can already control Exerian. This will be a safe process.\r
R&B.5.1.16=You know it's only dangerous when mishandled.
R&B.5.1.17=They’ve never NOT been mishandled\!\r
R&B.5.1.18=Talk to me\! We can solve this\! But controlling the Godi… that’s just impossible.
R&B.5.1.19=All YOU ever talk about is the past and what COULD happen.\r
R&B.5.1.2=You actually came here instead of going to Everod. I'm impressed.\r
R&B.5.1.20=I only care about what IS happening right now\! I stopped caring about WHAT IFs a long time ago.
R&B.5.1.21=Del… you’re going too far.\r
R&B.5.1.22=Who do you think invented the Godi in the first place? It wasn’t some evil wizard.\r
R&B.5.1.23=It was people like you and me who were trying to save their world.
R&B.5.1.24=And their inventions almost killed them all\!\r
R&B.5.1.25=Well LOOK AROUND. Anikka is falling apart\!\r
R&B.5.1.26=People… FAMILIES disappear in a matter of seconds because nobody dares to touch the Godi.
R&B.5.1.27=You’re scared of the world ending? Well MY World has ended a long time ago\!
R&B.5.1.28=Del. I'm going to stop you right here, right now.
R&B.5.1.29=You can't even touch me.
R&B.5.1.3=The mission was always to stop Operation "Godius". Attacking the factory was just a distraction.
R&B.5.1.4=So was Everod. They're not dead. We put them somewhere safe.\r\r
R&B.5.1.5=... I'll release them as soon as you join my cause.\r
R&B.5.1.6=All I want to do is make Anikka a better place for everyone.
R&B.5.1.7=Del… please listen to me. You weren't always like this...\r
R&B.5.1.8=You need to start looking at the bigger picture. We WILL destroy the Godi...
R&B.5.1.9=... But first we can use their power for the greater good.\r
R&B.5.2.1=Couldn’t even bother to show up huh.
R&B.5.2.10=For now?
R&B.5.2.11=Without Exerian, progress on our end does take a massive hit... 
R&B.5.2.12=I'm using a real Godius for this generation of myself… but I’ll find the others and get them all working in less than a year. 
R&B.5.2.13=Then Anikka will finally prosper with infinite power. This will work.
R&B.5.2.14=Something will go wrong Del.\nHumans make mistakes.
R&B.5.2.15=I don't.
R&B.5.2.2=I’m generating a copy of myself from the other side of the continent...
R&B.5.2.3=The power of the Godi is amazing isn’t it.
R&B.5.2.4=Exerian fought pretty well but... it's just a busted proto type isn't it.
R&B.5.2.5=So you've figured it out.
R&B.5.2.6=A real Godius wouldn’t crack.
R&B.5.2.7=Exactly.
R&B.5.2.8=Still feels good to break your toys though.
R&B.5.2.9=Yes you’ve successfully stopped our plans… for now.
R&B.Tutorial.1.1=In the battles of Red & Blue you are able to switch between two characters by using your ultra VOC\!
R&B.Tutorial.1.2=Try overcoming the odds by utilizing both characters to their full extent\!
Rozu.1=Aaah, the beautiful Bombarbara.\nWhat curves, what a smile,\nwhat a temperament...
Rozu.2=Mademoiselle.
Rozu.3=These gals have been popping up more and more lately... Well the more Noises I defeat the faster I can get back home.
Rozu.3.1=A QT... I remember one of your kind is responsible for... I would have never had to leave if it wasn't for you\!
Rozu.3.2=... Good.
Rozu.4=Watch out\!
Rozu.4.1=Hey watch-ou... wait why aren't these Noises attacking you?\!
Rozu.4.2=Oh. Uh... let's say we're friendly with them.
Rozu.4.3=You shouldn't be doing this. Noises are dangerous.
Rozu.4.4=It's all good man. We do what we do\nfor the greater good. You're a Noise\nHunter aren't you?
Rozu.4.5=Don't you want Noises and\nhumans to live in harmony?
Rozu.4.6=This cannot bring any good\!\nNoises are the enemy\!\nWe... we guard the roads\!
Rozu.5=Phew that was close.\nSofas just looove sinking their teeth\ninto human butts I tell ya\!
Rozu.5.1=Go away\! Away\!
Rozu.5.2=Hey you, wake up.
Rozu.5.3=Mo... mom?
Rozu.5.4=Whoa\! Slow down there buddy...
Rozu.5.5=Last I checked I wasn't a mother. But uh...\njust get him somewhere warm guys\!
Rozu.5.6=YES MA'AM\!
Rozu.5.7=Are we going home?
Rozu.5.8=That's up to you.\nI'm Cress by the way.
Rozu.5.9=Noise Hunter Rule \#1\:\nThere is always home.
Rozu.6=... Sooo... I'm Rozu\!\nDo you come here often?
Rozu.7=... I was really hoping he'd take me to dinner for savin his life but ok... man I'm starving.
Rozu.VS.Agent.1=You agents have no idea what you're doing\!
Rozu.VS.Agent.2=Yet we are controlling Noises, while you struggle to hunt them.
Rozu.VS.Cress.1=I thought my initiation was done.\r
Rozu.VS.Cress.2=Well if you're not hunting Noises, you can make yourself useful as a punching bag.
Rozu.VS.Del.1=I'll be lucky if I survive this one.
Rozu.VS.Del.2=It's valiant of you to try.
Rozu.VS.Fin.1=Nice drill. Is it a Voxel Generator?
Rozu.VS.Fin.2=Yeah\! And your VxG is inside your coat? Show me\!
Rozu.VS.Misc.1=I'll deal with you like I do with Noises\: Efficiently
Rozu.VS.Misc.2=See this coat? It means I'm a hunter\!
Rozu.VS.Misc.3=How about we settle this... like punks.
Rozu.VS.Misc.4=Sorry, but I'll have to pass through you.
Rozu.VS.Noise.1=What is a Noise? A miserable little pile of data\!
Rozu.VS.Noise.2=Let's do this Hunter Style\!
Rozu.VS.Noise.3=Came alone? Big mistake.
Rozu.VS.Noise.4=You might be a digital monster, but I'll be this battle's champion.
Rozu.VS.Noise.5=Did you just come here to become extinct?
Rozu.VS.Punk.1=Yo, lend me your knuckles. I need to train.
Rozu.VS.Punk.2=That is a funny coincidence. I just wanted to punch something\!
Rozu.VS.Rozu.1=Another Noise Hunter? …Wanna go out sometime?
Rozu.VS.Rozu.2=Dude, I'm literally you.
Rozu.VS.Spark.1=You look like a Noise\!
Rozu.VS.Spark.2=I thought we were friends… wait. You're kinda right though.
Rozu.VS.Yven.1=Do I know you?
Rozu.VS.Yven.2=You’re about to - Punk\!
Rozu.WIN.Misc.1=Hm... have I gotten stronger again?
Rozu.WIN.Misc.2=You're done already? Wow.
Rozu.WIN.Misc.3=OK come on, let's go again.
SaffronVSAgent.1.Text=Let's Ragna-ROCK\!
SaffronVSAgent.2.Text=Let's see if it's true what they say about you.
SaffronVSCress.1.Text=You're drawing dead\!
SaffronVSCress.2.Text=I'm drawing a line.
SaffronVSDel.1.Text=Show me how this worlds magic works\!
SaffronVSDel.2.Text=No magic. Only rock hard science.
SaffronVSFin.1.Text=Hey you\! Are you hiding Calamity Spells in that tank?
SaffronVSFin.2.Text=Uhm… it’s just ice… but you can’t have it.
SaffronVSMisc.Text=I'm kinda unbeatable y’know
SaffronVSNoise.Text=You’re kinda ugly... but also cute.
SaffronVSPunk.1.Text=Mind if I use you for field testing?
SaffronVSPunk.2.Text=Measure my punches? Please do\!
SaffronVSRozu.1.Text=Oh are you from the North? You know Selicy?
SaffronVSRozu.2.Text=Aren't you cold in that outfit?
SaffronVSSpark.1.Text=There’s nothing quite like going all out\!
SaffronVSSpark.2.Text=I always do, sister.
SaffronVSYven.1.Text=Finally someone magical\!
SaffronVSYven.2.Text=How rude\! I'm but a regular dude\!
SaffronWinAgent.Text=I'd rather listen to Violette\!
SaffronWinDel.Text=This friendship is the best\!
SaffronWinFin.Text=Let's study again sometime\!
SaffronWinMisc.Text=I'm pretty magical right?
SaffronWinPunk.Text=Some finesse would've helped you\!
SaffronWinRozu.Text=Love and tolerate\!
SaffronWinVSSpark.Text=Magic is my forte, what's yours?
SaffronWinYven.Text=I should be on Dels side\!
Shop.Agent.1=Love using my keytar VOC generator. Let's buy some ammunition.
Shop.Agent.10=Oh yeah. This'll do the trick.
Shop.Agent.11=But does it fit my outfit?
Shop.Agent.12=Is this VOC part of the official Azure Shield collection?
Shop.Agent.13=Are Agents supposed to use this VOC? I'm sure nobody will mind.
Shop.Agent.14=Does this fit my style?
Shop.Agent.2=Our budget recently increased. Let's use it wisely.
Shop.Agent.3=To achieve your dreams you need to prepare properly.
Shop.Agent.4=These VOCS are totally pianissimo\! If you know what I mean.
Shop.Agent.5=A stylish Agent needs some stylish VOCs\!
Shop.Agent.6=That's hot.
Shop.Agent.7=Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Those Punks won't know what hit them.
Shop.Agent.8=I love the sound this VOC makes.
Shop.Agent.9=This VOC deserves its own theme song.
Shop.Bella.1=I could really go for some cheesecake right now.
Shop.Bella.2=We must protect the people of Luna\!
Shop.Bella.3=Let's gear up for battle\!
Shop.Bella.4=I think that was a good decision\!
Shop.Bella.5=This will come in handy when battling Murks\!
Shop.Bella.6=Money well spent\!
Shop.Bella.7=I hope we can solve things without violence... but I'll need to protect myself.
Shop.Bella.8=Should I really buy this... instead of cheesecake bars?
Shop.Cress.1=Delicia invented VOCs... and I will use them against her.
Shop.Cress.10=I'd love to throw this in Del's face.
Shop.Cress.11=Wonder if Azure Shield is developing their own VOCs?
Shop.Cress.12=I really should stop losing my VOCs all the time... a good leader shouldn't be wasting money.
Shop.Cress.13=Back in the day we had no need for combat-VOCs... must've been weird.
Shop.Cress.14=Am I 100% sure about this?
Shop.Cress.2=Need to stack up on VOCS. Just in case I lose them again.
Shop.Cress.3=I COULD use some new rocket boots...but VOCs are more important right now I guess.
Shop.Cress.4=OK\! VOC TIME\! ...But maybe another coffee first?
Shop.Cress.5=I sometimes hear Spark murmuring my name while shopping... Oh wow\! I'm doing the same right now.
Shop.Cress.6=From archeologist to frequent VOC shopper. What is my life?
Shop.Cress.7=This'll make an impact\!
Shop.Cress.8=A punk used this one against me... couldn't land it though.
Shop.Cress.9=1,2,3 the baddest punk is me\!
Shop.Del.1=Do I make Ebits by buying my own invention?
Shop.Del.10=Maybe someday I'll go back to developing VOCs like these.
Shop.Del.11=Is this necessary for my arsenal?
Shop.Del.12=I like this one... it has a cute design.
Shop.Del.13=I remember who inspired me to code this one... hope she'll talk to me again someday.
Shop.Del.14=Hopefully we can stop using VOCs to fight each other one day.
Shop.Del.15=I remember when I designed VOCs for fun. That's a long time ago though...
Shop.Del.16=That's an interesting one. Shall I add it to my collection?
Shop.Del.2=Keep losing track of all the VOCs I've coded... maybe I've forgotten some?
Shop.Del.3=I hear young developers are creating their own VOCs... these are very exciting times.
Shop.Del.4=Maybe I could teach others how to code VOCs someday...
Shop.Del.5=I remember coding this one.
Shop.Del.6=A fine VOC. Could use an upgrade though.
Shop.Del.7=Worth the Ebits.
Shop.Del.8=Could this VOC be useful outside of combat?
Shop.Del.9=This will help us.
Shop.Fin.1=Better safe than ready\! ...Wait.
Shop.Fin.10=Am I sure that I want to spend my Ebits for this?
Shop.Fin.11=Am I positive that I can't just use one of Dad's old Vocs instead of this?
Shop.Fin.12=JUST BUY IT ALREADY... wait do I really deserve this though?
Shop.Fin.13=There should be a VOC-Library to try them out for free... I'd be there all day, everyday.
Shop.Fin.2=Buying VOCs is so exciting\! I can't wait to study them someday.
Shop.Fin.3=I've been saving up for this shopping spree\! ...I'll only buy the essentials.
Shop.Fin.4=This'll make a great gift for Spark\!
Shop.Fin.5=Hope I won't need to use that one... but you never know.
Shop.Fin.6=Am I splurging too much?
Shop.Fin.7=I shouldn't use too many Bits... but i guess it's OK to use them for VOCs... sometimes.
Shop.Fin.8=Guess I'll just skip breakfast tomorrow... and the rest of the week.
Shop.Fin.9=Mom always said that it's okay to treat yourself sometimes... not that she ever did though.
Shop.Punk.1=Punching is great\! But sometimes you need something... punchier.
Shop.Punk.10=This VOC'll make Cress notice me for sure.
Shop.Punk.11=Now what is the right balance between using VOCs and using your muscles?
Shop.Punk.12=WHOA, that one was expensive. I think. Not sure how money works.
Shop.Punk.13=Is this somethin' I really want?
Shop.Punk.2=Cress says we need to stock up on VOCs. I wonder if I can buy a second pair of fists though.
Shop.Punk.3=You gotta spend money to... punch Agents better.
Shop.Punk.4=Yo. Yo Yo Yo. Azure Shield won't like that one.
Shop.Punk.5=I'd love to someday be able to fight just using my fists... but until then this'll be useful.
Shop.Punk.6=Can I combine this with a punch?
Shop.Punk.7=Maybe after we finish off Azure Shield I could learn to develop VOCs myself?
Shop.Punk.8=Dope.
Shop.Punk.9=I can just imagine blasting this one while infiltrating an Azure Base\!
Shop.Rozu.1=Time to shop to make Azure Shield... stop? ...Look at me I'm a Punk.
Shop.Rozu.10=Noises hate this one. Maybe I should buy another.
Shop.Rozu.11=Hmm... should I really buy this?
Shop.Rozu.12=Am I compensating...? Yeah maybe but this will be good for swatting Agents.
Shop.Rozu.13=Spark used this one to beat me yesterday... maybe I can learn from that.
Shop.Rozu.2=I need to be ready in case some Noises come to town.
Shop.Rozu.3=Back home I was only allowed to use so many Vocs... this will be so much fun\!
Shop.Rozu.4=I wonder what other VOC would go well with this...
Shop.Rozu.5=I remember seeing another Hunter using this one\!
Shop.Rozu.6=I need to be careful with that\!
Shop.Rozu.7=No better way to spend my money...
Shop.Rozu.8=With this I'll beat Spark for sure.
Shop.Rozu.9=I wonder how many VOCs the average Punk uses?
Shop.Saffron.1=Shopping\!\!\!
Shop.Saffron.2=Where's the shop keeper? I want to fight\!
Shop.Saffron.3=It's business time.
Shop.Saffron.4=This won't dissapear after I lose?
Shop.Saffron.5=Yay for capitalism\!
Shop.Saffron.6=Who do I attack for these prices?
Shop.Spark.1=Hoho\! Let's burn some cash.
Shop.Spark.10=NICE. This'll annoy the agents for sure\!
Shop.Spark.11=This is what Ebits are for. I wonder if Cress will ever pay me?
Shop.Spark.12=Been meaning to find a Voc that I could beat Cress with.
Shop.Spark.13=I probably don't NEED this VOC to beat the Agents... but why not have a little fun\!
Shop.Spark.14=Am I positive I can't find this VOC inside of my soul?
Shop.Spark.15=Do I want to own this VOC? Can one really own anything in this world?
Shop.Spark.16=Excess is poison for the soul. But this VOC'll surely be poison to Azure Shield as well hehe.
Shop.Spark.2=Tree-monks aren't really allowed to own money... better spend it then\!
Shop.Spark.3=My master back home wouldn't like me dabbling in shops... Guess there are perks to getting out of there\!
Shop.Spark.4=I'm probably stronger than Cress already... Won't hurt to expand my arsenal though.
Shop.Spark.5=Maybe there are some VOCs that will catch Cress off-guard? ...Oh and the Agents of course. Focus.
Shop.Spark.6=Ah someday I'll show this VOC to Mastress.
Shop.Spark.7=I've been looking for that\!
Shop.Spark.8=Wonder what this'll do?
Shop.Spark.9=This'll fit my fighting style.
Shop.TriWing.1=FUEL LEVELS... OK\! SHOPPING ENGAGED\!

Spark.1=Spark\! Spark\! Spark\! Spark\!
Spark.2=Alright... Here we go\!
Spark.2.1=Th-thanks\!
Spark.2.2=Noises? Shouldn't this\narea be protected?
Spark.2.3=They usually are... \nThank you so much\!\nOh snap it's late... gotta go\!
Spark.2.4=Oh uh, you're welcome\!
Spark.3=Ms. Spark has won our monthly tournament... again\!
Spark.3.1=Man, I feel pumped. Wish I could do something... purposeful like that more often. Tournaments are a waste of time...
Spark.3.10=If Noises ever make it to Everod my little brother would... yes. Please teach me.
Spark.3.11=... Sure. I don't have anything else to do right now. Lesson 1\: If you get hit too often in a row you'll get crushed
Spark.3.12=But I barely can provide for myself and my brother... sorry I'll leave you alone.
Spark.3.2=Hey\!
Spark.3.3=Oh. Heyy... do you want to take me out to dinner?
Spark.3.4=No, no\! I mean... I would if I could afford it haha.
Spark.3.5=Hey are you ok dude?
Spark.3.6=Ouch\! But I think \nI'm getting the hang of this\!
Spark.3.7=Practice makes perfect\!\nC'mon let's try again.
Spark.3.8=Yes, thanks to you.\nIf you hadn't helped me back at the tournament...
Spark.3.9=Yo, these are dangerous times.\nYou better learn to fight for yourself.
Spark.4=The prize money will get me\nthrough the next month... phew\!
Spark.4.1=Whoa\! Almost had me there for a second.\nYou're really motivated aren't you?
Spark.4.10=... huh
Spark.4.11=Oh no\! It's already late\! Sorry, but I gotta get to Adam\!
Spark.4.2=Yes... I need to be able to\nprotect my little brother.\nI'm all he has left.
Spark.4.3=... Where do you guys live?
Spark.4.4=Everod. I manage to pay for a small apartment by hunting down artefacts in the ice.
Spark.4.5=Oh man. That's rough buddy.
Spark.4.6=It... is. But that is exactly why I'm glad I met y-
Spark.4.7=... So he CAN actually move.\nMust be nice to have someone you want to protect.
Spark.4.8=Noises again\! What's with the Noise protection these days? Well, I'm already warmed up so let's go\!
Spark.4.9=You won't hurt any civilians on my watch\!\nI am Spark, the protector of Everod\!\!
Spark.5=Yup, that just paid for barely enough hormones and food...
Spark.5.1=Fin said he'd like to train again today. That's his place? Wait a second...
Spark.5.2=Hey\!
Spark.5.3=Hey what are you doing whispering in front of my friends house?
Spark.5.4=N-nothing?
Spark.5.5=I heard about you guys\! You're looking for artefacts don't you?\nBut don't even think about disturbing my Fin- I mean my friend\!
Spark.5.6=Let's get out of here\!\nShe's crazy\!
Spark.5.7=Another day, another good deed\!\nOk now let's see if Fin has any snacks at his place...
